"No Me Queda Más" ("There's Nothing Left for Me") is a song by American recording artist Selena for her fourth studio album, Amor Prohibido (1994). Written by Ricky Vela and produced by Selena's brother A.B. Quintanilla, it was released as the third single from the album in October 1994 by EMI Latin. It is a downtempo mariachi and pop ballad that portrays a woman who wishes the best for her former lover despite her own agony. Praised by music critics for its raw emotion, "No Me Queda Más" was one of the most successful singles of Selena's career, topping the Billboard Hot Latin Songs chart for seven non-consecutive weeks. It was the Song of the Year at the 1995 Broadcast Music Awards and became the most successful US Latin single of 1995. Billboard magazine ranked it ninth on a list of Tejano recordings. A music video, shot in San Antonio's Amtrak station, received the Music Video of the Year award at the Billboard Latin Music Awards. Many musicians have recorded cover versions, including Mexican singer Pepe Aguilar, American salsa singer Tito Nieves, and Mexican pop group Palomo. (Full article...)

Six hundred and fourteen medals were earned at the 1982 Asian Games (also known as the IX Asiad), a multi-sport event held in Delhi, India, from 12 November to 4 December 1982. A total of 3,411 athletes from 33 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in these games, competing in 147 events in 21 sports and 22 disciplines. The number of participating countries was the greatest in Asian Games history. Handball, equestrian, rowing and golf were included for the first time; fencing and bowling were excluded. Athletes from 23 participating NOCs won at least one medal; athletes from 16 of these NOCs secured at least one gold. Athletes from China won 61 gold medals, the most of any nation at these games, and led the gold-medal count for the first time in their Asiad history. Athletes from both China and Japan won the most total medals, with 153. South Korea finished third in total medals. North Korea finished fifth in total medals, and fourth in the gold-medal count. Host nation India finished the games with 57 medals overall (13 gold, 19 silver and 25 bronze, its best performance since 1951), in fifth spot in terms of total gold medals. (Full list...)
2.2. ESTABLlSHlNt ETHICAL
RESEARCH GUIDELINES
Each management agency should adapt current guidelines
or develop a set of ethical research guidelines meeting
local requirements for researchers seeking to conduct
research in protected and environmentally sensitive areas,
Development, implementation and oversight of ethical
guidelines could be through an Environmental Research
Ethics Advisory Committee or other deliberative process,
These should include guidelines addressing the need to
protect and conserve the cultural heritage of both nonindigenous
and indigenous Australians.
The advisory committee would also be responsible for
making decisions on the permitting and conduct of
research.
2.3 ENSURING ANY DELIBERATIVE
PROCESS CONSIDERS ETHICAL ISSUES
Each management agency should ensure that ethical issues
are consideredi n the assessmenot f a researchp roposalf or
the area. A range of deliberative processes may be
adopted. The purpose of the deliberative process is to
provide a formal mechanism for advising the relevant
agency whether the research proposed constitutes
reasonable use of the area and is in accordance with
Precautionary Principle and the maxims of Movement,
Minimisation, Modification and Maximisation. Indicative
criteria for referral of a research proposal to a deliberative
process on ethical considerations are at Appendix 1, and
assessment guidelines which could guide a deliberative
process are at Appendix 2. This report suggests referral to
a speciacl ommittee,w hich it termsa n EnvironmentaRl esearch
EthicsA dvisoryC ommittee( EREAC)a,s the most appropriate
process in most cases, though it acknowledges alternative
processesc ould be used. Accordingly,s uggestedg uidelines
for the operationo f EREACasr e provideda s Appendix 3.
If the EREAC is the chosen deliberative process, the
management agency should either:
l formally accesse xternal EREACsw ith the expertise
required to address the issues raised in this document,
or
l establish, in consultation with their day-to-day
managers,E REAC(sd)i rectly responsiblet o the
governing body of the agency or its delegate(s).
The form of deliberative process
The form of deliberative process will differ in response to
the nature and scale of the protected or sensitive area in
question. For highly protected areas such as terrestrial
national parks and certain areas of marine parks, it is likely
that referral of most proposals will be appropriate. For
multiple use protected or sensitive areas it is likely that a
system with general oversight and provisions which
identifies and refers critical applications will be more
appropriate.
The key to the proposed process is that it is a means of
providing formal and independent advice to the
appropriate Minister, CEO or delegated decision maker
under the legislation or agreement which addresses
management of the protected or environmentally sensitive
area.
The operation of such a system should provide means for:
l appeal against, or review of, a decision, or
l for the decision maker to act contrary to advice but with
the requirement to provide a statement of reasons for
rejecting the advice.
The arrangement must be sufficiently open for there to be
general confidence that scrutiny is effective and properly

The mannature relationship and
environmental ethics
Ph. Bourdeau 
Universite´ Libre de Bruxelles, Bruxelles 1050, Belgium
Received 1 May 2002; accepted 1 May 2003
Abstract
Our behaviour and policies with regard to nature and the environment should be guided
by a code of ethics, which is to be derived from basic principles and from a pragmatic consideration
of the issues at stake. The man–nature relationship has always been ambiguous,
nature being seen as both a provider and an enemy. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, man is
set apart from nature and called to dominate it, although this attitude has been revised to
become one of stewardship. Oriental religions, on the other hand, have a more holistic view
and consider humans as an integral part of nature. Modern philosophers have views ranging
from anthropocentrism to biocentrism and egocentrism. It is suggested to take a pragmatic
approach by which primary human needs are met first and foremost whereas the needs of
other living organisms and ecosystems are allowed to prevail over secondary human needs.
A plea is made to support the Earth Charter, which embodies in its principles and prescriptions
a balanced respect for nature and future human generations.

1. Introduction
Nature can be seen as beautiful and harmonious but it also inspires fear in man
who has had to fight it in order to survive. Now, nature is threatened by man who
has become detached from it. Technology has endowed humans with the power of
a major geological agency, which may act on a continental or even planetary scale
(e.g. acid rain, photochemical smog, radioactive contamination, stratospheric
ozone depletion, climate change).

These man-made environmental problems cannot all be solved by technology
alone. Changes in human behaviour are necessary, hence the need for codes of
conduct based on the ethics of the environment. The relationship between man and
nature must be reconsidered.
What is nature, what is the environment? Nature is the whole of the physical
world; it is also what exists outside of any human action. Man is in nature but he
acts upon it, thereby emancipating himself of it. He is part and apart of nature.
The human–nature relationship is the object, in western societies at least, of contradictory
representations. There is, on the one hand, a nostalgia for the lost paradise
and on the other a primitive fear of natural forces but also the urge to
dominate nature, which originated with the Renaissance.
The environment has been defined in many different ways, from Einstein’s definition
(‘everything that is not us’) to that of the European Union: ‘The whole set
of elements which form the frameworks, the surroundings and the living conditions
of man and society, as they are or as they are perceived’. In fact the notion of
environment includes always nature and culture. The environment may be viewed
as an emerging property of the man–nature relation, a field of reciprocal transformation
of the human by the natural; and of the natural by the human (Ost,
1995).
2. A very brief review of attitudes toward nature and the environment
For the classical Greek philosophers the rational structure of the world was considered
as simple and therefore they had no insight into the complexities of ecological
systems. They were in fact the originators of the reductionist attitude that is
still prevalent in many fields of science It has been argued that it is from Plato’s
ideas (‘The natural world is an illusion’) that the medieval attitude that ‘Love of
nature detracts from love of God’ was derived.
Exceptions were Aristotle and Theophrastus. For the first, everything in nature
had a purpose (teleology). The world was a gigantic mass of matter undergoing
continuous change generated by the ‘Prime Nover’, and it existed for the benefit of
man. Theophrastus understood the interactions between living organisms and their
habitats and could thus be considered as the first ecologist.
The emperor and stoic philosopher Marcus Aurelius, on the other hand, stated
that the universe was a single living being, possessed of a single substance and a
single soul, and that what was good and right in itself was to live in harmony with
nature.
In the Judeo-Christian tradition, Genesis says that, (I–11), on the second day,
God created the herbs and the trees that bear seed and fruit, on the fourth ( I–20),
the creeping creatures and the fowl, on the fifth (I–24–25), the beasts of the earth
according to their kinds, cattle and creeping things.
Then God said (I–26) ‘Let us make man to our image and likeness; and let him
have dominion over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air, and the beasts,
and the whole earth, and every creeping creature...’.
10 Ph. Bourdeau / J. Environ. Radioactivity 72 (2004) 9–15
And God created man to his own image..... Male and female he created them
(I–27).
And God blessed them (I–28) saying: ‘Increase and multiply, and fill the earth
and subdue it and rule over the fishes of the sea and the fowls of the air and all
living creatures that move upon the earth’.
Later on, after the deluge, God blessed Noah (Genesis 9) and his sons and said:
Increase and multiply and fill the earth ..... and let the fear and dread of you be
upon... the beasts, the fowls, the creeping things and all the fishes of the sea,
they are delivered into your hand and every thing that moves and lives will be
meat for you....... I will establish my covenant with you and with your seed,
after you.
Thus God created the other living beings for man and man for God.
For Francis Bacon we must subdue nature, penetrate its secrets and chain it to
satisfy our desires. Man is the center of the world and the object of science is to
dominate nature. The same idea was taken up by Descartes who stated that we
should use science to make us ‘masters and possessors of nature’.
This has been often quoted to express the alleged Christian view of the relationship
between man and nature. Descartes, who considered animals as non-sentient
mechanical beings, clearly proclaimed the duality of body and soul, a view rejected
by Leibnitz who stressed the interconnections between the living and non-living
parts of the world.
Spinoza, on the other hand, had a pantheistic vision in which every being and
object was a temporary manifestation of a common substance created by God.
Thus nature would be reduced, according to the Judeo-Christian tradition, to the
single dimension of an object that can be appropriated. This may have been a reaction
against the pagan veneration of nature (springs, rivers, mountains). One
remarkable exception was St Francis of Assisi. His Canticle of All Creatures celebrates
brother Sun, sister Moon, brothers Wind and Air, sister Water, brother Fire
and sister Earth and her flowers, herbs and fruits.
Lynn White, in an oft-quoted paper of 1967 (White, 1967), which had much
impact in the English-speaking world, accused Christianity of being the most
anthropocentric of the religions, thus allowing uncontrolled exploitation of natural
resources and widespread pollution of the environment.
In fact, contemporary exponents of Christianity and Judaism have pointed out
that the word ‘dominion’ should be understood as meaning really ‘custody’ or
‘stewardship’. In his 1990 encyclical ‘Gaudium and Spes’, Pope John-Paul II stated
that it was a moral duty for Christians to take care of the earth in order that it
produced fruit and became the worthy home of the universal human family. Elsewhere,
he said that it was urgent to develop the awareness of the respect of natural
resources. The protestant churches have voiced similar positions through their
World Council of Churches.
Ph. Bourdeau / J. Environ. Radioactivity 72 (2004) 9–15 11
The idea of stewardship of nature is found also in the Koran. In sutra 33:72 it is
said that this responsibility was first offered to the heaven, to the earth and the
mountains but these refused this charge and man had to shoulder it.
According to the Talmud, if God created the world starting from chaos, he left
some parts incomplete and entrusted them to man, who has a co-creator role and
is the guardian of the capacity of the earth to renew itself (‘Till the earth and keep
it’).
Contrary to the religions of the Book, Hinduism, Buddhism, Taoism, Shinto do
not consider that mankind, nature and the divine are distinct. They take a position
which is intermediate between monism and dualism and are more concerned with
harmony, union, interconnections. Buddhism, for instance, affirms the interdependency
of all beings and advocates moderation and respect of all forms of life.
Since Descartes, Leibnitz and Spinoza, philosophers and other thinkers have
adopted ethical positions with regard to nature which range from absolute anthropocentrism
to biocentrism and the most radical ecocentrism.
Anthropocentrism, which can be more or less enlightened, aims at protecting the
environment in view only of the direct and indirect interests of mankind. This may
cover not only material needs for survival and well-being but also amenities and
aesthetic satisfaction, and may justify changes in basic rights, such as property
rights. An additional element in this respect, introduced by the concept of sustainable
development, is concern about future generations (see below).
Biocentrism recognizes the intrinsic value of life and living beings, regardless of
their instrumental value for mankind, while ecocentrism advocates that environmental
ethics should give due consideration to ecosystems, including their nonliving
natural objects. Forests, lakes, wetlands etc. are valuable in their own right
and deserve moral consideration.
The 19th century Wilderness movement in the USA, represented by Emerson,
Wordsworth and Thoreau, and which led to the creation of the Sierra Club and
much later to that of Friends of the Earth, sought communication with God
through nature. Its object was to promote a world oriented toward a bioethics, in
which mankind would live in harmony with nature, which provides subsistence and
survival.
The German philosopher, Hans Jonas, affirmed in 1984 that we must be guardians
of nature and of future generations, whose interests are closely confounded
inasmuch as they are weakened to the point where their persistence is no longer
assured. We are responsible for the future since we are capable of compromising it.
He added that there was an obligation to be prudent (hence the development of the
precautionary principle) as well as an obligation to know (through scientific
research) in order to assess the consequences of our actions.
A debate on the future generations has been started among ethicists, with possible
implications for such issues as climate change and the disposal of long-lived
radioactive waste. How many of these generations should be taken into account?
Do they have moral standing even though they do not yet exist? Can someone represent
their interests? Is there an implicit social contract between past, present and
12 Ph. Bourdeau / J. Environ. Radioactivity 72 (2004) 9–15
future generation? Answers to these questions are difficult. A prudent view is that
we should leave as many options as possible to the future generations.
As far as ecocentrism is concerned, the most extreme view is that of the so-called
‘deep ecology’ movement. Propounded by the Norwegian philosopher Arne Ness,
starting in 1973 (Shrader-Frechette, 1991), it holds that the value of non-human
living beings is independent of their utility to man. Biological diversity, for
example, has an intrinsic value (a view which is, somewhat surprisingly, recognized
in the International Convention for the Protection of Biological Diversity of 1992)
and man has no right to reduce this richness except to satisfy his vital needs. Some
adepts of deep ecology go even further, stating that the welfare of ecosystems, may
require a reduction of human population because its interference has become
excessive. According to Ness, the solution of the environmental problems requires
a fundamental behaviour change. We must recognize that we are part of nature,
that we are constituted by our relationship to the other elements of the environment
(metaphysical holism), that there is no ontological separation in the realm of
existence. We are nothing but dissipative structures existing only through matter
and energy flows, as a vortex in a flowing fluid (as in Buddhism).
It is suggested, as proposed by K. Shrader-Frechette (Yamin and Farhana,
1997), to adopt a position somewhere between anthropocentrism and ecocentrism.
Ethical priorities should be as follows:
. obligation to recognizing primary, or strong, human rights: survival, health, welfare;
. obligation not to harm the environment;
. recognition of secondary (weak) human needs: property, some forms of transport,
leisure (e.g. the off-road use of 44 vehicles), gastronomy, etc.
Criticism of the acknowledged weakness of the theoretical foundations of
environmental ethics can be addressed by pointing out that currently well-established
moral schools have evolved and been improved over many years, while we
are at the beginning of a moral framework, which is essential because, in the
absence of a world government, international cooperation can be based only on a
high sense of a shared morality.
3. An ethics (or philosophy) of the environment
Ethics is concerned with the way we should behave. Meta-ethics defines the concepts
of good and bad, duties and obligations, moral responsibility; normative ethics,
what is good or bad, the actions that are correct or not. There is also a branch
of ethics which is concerned with policies and institutions, the principles and rules
which govern the allocation of goods and resources.
Environmental ethics is that part of applied ethics which examines the moral
basis of our responsibility toward the environment. The fundamental questions are
the following (Naess, 1973):
Ph. Bourdeau / J. Environ. Radioactivity 72 (2004) 9–15 13
. what are the obligations of the whole of mankind toward the natural world?
. how to allocate the benefits and charges deriving from the respect of these obligations?
. what policies and institutional structures should be established to implement
them?
To the first question, the answer may be that we have obligations toward the
natural world which impose quantitative and qualitative limits to our exploitation
of nature.
To the second question, the argument is that of international justice and equity;
may we say that the developing countries are entitled to compensation for the
exploitation by industrialized countries of their natural resources, in terms both of
products and waste disposal? Other points are the distribution of future charges
(burden-sharing), for instance with regard to reduction in greenhouse gases emissions,
the property of genetic resources and of the benefits of biotechnology.
As to the third question: beyond existing arrangements (national and EU policies,
international conventions), is these a need for a world-wide body, a World
Environment and Development Organization (WEDO) to counterbalance the
World Trade Organization?
4. Conclusion
Whether environmental norms are human constructs or find their origin in the
divine, in reason or mere empiricism, they prescribe restrictions in freedom of
action, which are self-imposed by the recognition that the human individual is part
of a community of interdependent parts (human generations and ecosystems). To
define these norms, it behoves to distinguish between the fundamental and the secondary
needs of humans and not to sacrifice to the latter the interests of nonhuman
living organisms.
The sustainability paradigm must be raised to the level of a global ethics which
recognizes and promotes the mutualism of social and ecological values. In concrete
terms, this ethics must lead to the control of production and consumption patterns
so as to preserve the regenerative capacity of natural resources as well as the natural
cycles and balances. Moderation must prevail, as well as prudence or precaution.
The Earth Charter Document (2001), which has been prepared by a private
group led by Maurice Strong, the great humanitarian who organized the 1972
Stockholm Conference on the Hunan Environment and the 1992 Rio Conference
on Environment and Development, embodies the principles and rules of conduct
which should guide the behaviour of individuals, business and nations. It should be
strongly supported because, as stated more than 1800 years ago by Marcus Aurelius,
what is good and just for man is to live in harmony with nature.

The study group is throwing Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) a baby shower in their usual meeting room in the library. Annie (Alison Brie) got Shirley's child two gifts. It's not clear whether the father is Shirley's formerly separated husband Andre (Malcolm-Jamal Warner) or Ben Chang (Ken Jeong), and so, wanting to "cover all ethnic bases", Annie gives Shirley a doll representing an African-American girl, and a note from the manufacturer promising to increase the racial diversity of their selection. Chang appears disappointed when Shirley and Andre state emphatically that, whoever the baby's biological father is, Shirley and Andre will raise the baby as their own.

Britta (Gillian Jacobs) asks Abed (Danny Pudi) and Troy (Donald Glover) who the cute boy was that she had seen hanging out with them. They tell him he's their new friend, Luka (Enver Gjokaj), and that he's a lot of fun -- and thus she is forbidden from pursuing him, as they don't want another friend "ruined" by Britta divulging his secrets. Britta does not comply, and makes an excuse to stop by as Luka is playing video games with his friends. She easily convinces him to see her later, over Troy and Abed's loud groans.

Shirley asks Jeff (Joel McHale) to help talk Chang into signing a document forfeiting his parental rights, in case he is the biological father. Jeff tries to get out of it by arguing that Chang won't really try to act as the child's father, but Shirley points out that Chang is rather unpredictable, and points down the hall at him, where he is spinning around in a circle, seemingly trying to attack his own backpack. Jeff sighs and promises to try to get Chang to sign the document, for the sake of the child.

Britta and Luka are making out when she suddenly asks him to keep their liaison a secret. He promises, and alludes to his life in the Balkans and things he doesn't like to talk about. Britta realizes he must have seen war and genocide, and tells her that he can talk with her about anything. Luka begins to describe the horrible violence and atrocities he witnessed -- and says that he desperately misses cleansing his country of the "unclean people". Britta is horrified but can't figure out a way to tell Troy and Abed that their new friend is a war criminal without being guilty of "ruining" another friend of theirs just like they predicted.

Jeff arrives home to find Chang, whom he'd grudgingly agreed to stay with him temporarily, sawing off the legs of his coffee table rather than looking for a job. Jeff gives him the document and Chang starts to cry. Jeff realizes that he can use this to his advantage, and encourages Chang to get a job and an apartment -- saying that Shirley will allow Chang to be a part of the baby's life if he seems like a responsible adult. The next day Chang shows up with a pipe trying to mimic being responsible. His behavior remains erratic and inexplicable -- for instance, he installs aluminum siding on a pool table in the cafeteria.

Abed and Troy are playing video games with Luka again, who shows them that in the game they're playing, they can get extra points for killing innocent villagers. Britta walks in and tries to make an excuse to talk to them but is horrified at Luka's evident glee at slaughtering innocents, even though this time they're only video game characters. As she leaves she hatches a plan to steal one of their DVDs, in an attempt to frame Luka. But Abed and Troy have video footage of her taking the disc, and they demand to know why she's attempting to ruin another friend of theirs. By way of explanation, she bursts out with the news that Luka is a war criminal -- which Troy and Abed don't believe.

Jeff comes home to find Chang with two young black boys, teaching them Spanish (badly). He tells Jeff that they're Shirley's sons, and that he picked them up after school to prove that he could be a responsible father. Jeff tells him he's a kidnapper and insists that Chang call Shirley to beg forgiveness while he takes the kids home. The boys, however, tell Chang that their mom isn't named Shirley. Jeff tells Chang to get out as he leaves to take the kids home -- but as soon as he's gone, Chang calls the cops to report a kidnapping. Jeff manages to get out of trouble quickly, though -- Shirley had persuaded the boys' actual mother not to press charges. They see Chang being arrested -- apparently the boys' mom is pressing charges against Chang. Jeff tells her that Chang could get three to five years on a child endangerment charge, and that instead, using the fact that Chang had attempted to teach the boys Spanish, they could put him away for twenty years for child trafficking. Andre talks Shirley and Jeff out of their plan, though, showing sympathy for Chang.

Troy and Abed come up to Britta and reveal that they believed her enough to ask Luka questions about his past. They apologize for doubting her and tell her not to conceal anything like this in the future.
Troy (Donald Glover) and Abed (Danny Pudi) invite the study group to their housewarming party. In particular, they call attention to their Indiana Jones boulder escape scene diorama. Once everyone has arrived, they begin playing Yahtzee. The pizza delivery man, Toby (Robert Tarpinian), arrives, and someone has to go downstairs to collect the pizza. Everyone agrees to Jeff's (Joel McHale) plan to roll a die to determine who has to get the pizza.

The episode then splits into different timelines—as noted by Abed throughout, to his friends' confusion—with each alternate timeline playing out every possible outcome of the die roll. Every timeline features running gags which end differently depending on which characters are present or absent:

Britta (Gillian Jacobs) plays "Roxanne" by The Police on the iPod stereo system and begins to sing along to it, but Jeff cuts her off.
Pierce (Chevy Chase) attempts to introduce his story about having had sex with Eartha Kitt in an airplane bathroom into the conversation.
Britta excuses herself after Jeff slams her down in order to visit the bathroom to smoke marijuana covertly.
Annie (Alison Brie) has a gun in her bag.
Pierce gives Troy a housewarming gift, a Norwegian troll (wrapped in a box), which frightened Troy while he lived in Pierce's mansion earlier in the series.
Jeff gets up from the table to get a drink, hitting his head on the ceiling fan in the process. Annie tends to him, while Pierce and Troy laugh at him.
Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) is baking pies in order to curry favor with the group, though the others disapprove of her manipulative tactic of using baking to gain love.
The boulder in the Indiana Jones diorama begins to roll down whenever someone closes the door, but Abed stops it before it reaches the bottom.
The pizza man is called ugly or creepy.
Abed wonders aloud what happens in all the other timelines, but Jeff dismissively says there are no other timelines.
In the first timeline, Jeff rolls a two and Annie (who is sitting second on his left around the table) goes to get the pizza. Troy opens Annie's purse to find a gun, and is too distracted to open Pierce's present. Abed confronts Britta about the smell of marijuana in the bathroom, which offends her.

In the second timeline, Jeff rolls a four and Shirley has to go. She reminds the group to take her pies out of the oven before leaving. Troy opens Pierce's present and freaks out. When Shirley returns, she finds that her pies were left in the oven to burn. She berates the group and leaves.

In the third timeline, the die lands on three and Pierce has to go. Jeff belittles Troy, which causes him to leave the table and join Britta in the bathroom. She consoles Troy by mocking Jeff's guarded personality. Annie demonstrates her first aid skills when tending to Jeff. When Pierce returns with the pizza, everyone is happy.

In the fourth timeline, Jeff rolls a six and Britta has to go. Annie tends to Jeff in the bathroom since Britta isn't using it. Jeff expresses his concern for Annie, but just as they are about to kiss, they are interrupted by Troy screaming. Pierce is terrorizing him with the troll, and reveals that he is upset that Troy has moved out from his mansion. Britta returns with the pizza man, doped, and announces they are now engaged.

In the fifth timeline, Jeff rolls a one and Troy has to go. He leaves in a hurry, so as not to miss anything interesting, and slams the door, which causes the diorama boulder to slip and roll onto the floor. Britta and Abed leave for the bathroom, not noticing the boulder. When Annie stands up, she trips over it and falls on the coffee table, in turn displacing Pierce's bottle of rum, which shatters on the floor. Pierce abruptly rises from the table in reaction to the fall, knocking Annie's purse to the floor. The gun inside discharges and hits Pierce in the thigh. Abed rushes to help Annie with Pierce, while Britta comes out of the bathroom and goes slack-jawed upon seeing Pierce on the floor; her lit joint drops from her mouth and ignites the spilled rum. Jeff attempts to smother the fire with his shirt, only for it to catch fire itself and get wrapped around Jeff's right arm. Britta attempts to put out the fire by dropping glasses of water onto it. Troy returns to a scene of chaos with the troll doll, having been knocked from the table during the kerfuffle, staring directly at him from amid the flames, causing him to scream in horror.

In the sixth timeline, Jeff rolls a five, meaning Abed has to go. Forgetting the others' refusal to eat Shirley's pies, Britta does so, at the same time inadvertently revealing that she smoked marijuana, to Shirley's great dismay, and they confront each other about their respective "habits". Troy says a few kind words to Pierce, which causes Pierce to attempt to rescind the gift. In the ensuing struggle, the troll is flung out of the box. Jeff and Annie kiss at the kitchen counter, but Annie kills the mood inadvertently by saying that Jeff's actions remind her of her father; he belittles her for the remark and for using too much lip gloss. Abed returns to an awkward situation but acts obliviously ("I hope this is the real [timeline] because I just found a nickel in the hallway").

In the final, prime[1] timeline, Abed stops the die from rolling and urges the group to stay united regardless of whatever happens to them. He then informs the group that Jeff manipulated the die roll such that he would never be selected, resulting in the group berating Jeff for his deception. In the end, Jeff has to get the pizza. After he leaves (hitting his head as he stands) and Britta puts on "Roxanne", the five other group members sing and dance to the song. Pierce decides not to give Troy his gift and discards the doll. Abed invites Annie to move in with him and Troy.

The end tag shows the universe in which Troy got the pizza. With the (remaining) group members sitting around the study table, it is revealed that Pierce is dead, Annie has been institutionalized after going insane with guilt for having indirectly caused it, Shirley is an alcoholic, Troy injured his larynx trying to destroy the flaming troll (he tried to eat it) and can only speak with the assistance of an artificial voice box, Jeff is missing an arm, and Britta has a blue streak in her hair. Abed declares that, as this is "the darkest timeline", they must become "the evil study group" and find a way to enter the "prime timeline" and take control over it. He hands out black felt goatees to the others, mimicking the Star Trek: The Original Series episode "Mirror, Mirror". Depressed, Britta, Jeff, and Shirley depart, but Troy stays behind; he and Abed don the goatees, singing "Evil Troy and Evil Abed," a variation on the series’ running gag of "Troy and Abed in the Morning." Suddenly, the scene changes via the reverse of the dice roll animation used throughout the episode (the camera zooms out from that timeline to the prime timeline at the center this time) to the "prime" Abed and Troy watching TV, where Abed mentions that something felt strange for a moment, but dismisses it without a thought.
Remedial Chaos Theory" is another concept episode, which is popular among fans.[2][3] Despite the alternate realities, each story was part of a cohesive narrative.[4] The episode's structure depicted how the characters relate to each other in different situations. How the situation changes each time a character leaves suggests the character's role within the group.[2][3][5] Some characters always get along easily, some of them do not, and ultimately the group dynamic requires everyone to work.[5]

In Jeff's absence, the group lets loose and has fun. Jeff cannot bring himself to do the same because he enjoys being cool and detached.[3] Annie wishes that everyone would be less worried about her and view her as an adult.[3][5] Troy prevents chaos; when he is gone, the situation dissolves into madness.[3] He also wishes that Jeff would view him as an adult.[3][5] Shirley feels left out because she is the only one happily married.[3] She plays a maternal role, quick to anger with everyone as she simultaneously tries to guide and nurture them. However, the other group members often refuse to take responsibility and mock her judgement even though they secretly like her mini-pies.[2] Meanwhile, Pierce is upset that Troy moved out even though he seems so happy and he constantly attempts to impress Jeff by trying to prove his own masculinity.[3] Abed dispels tension: without him, the other study group members are uncomfortable with each other.

At Cornell University Fowler fronted the rock band Proven Guilty. After moving to New York City Fowler founded the acoustic pop project Tonto Tonto with Grammy Award-nominated guitarist and producer Gregg Wattenberg and bassist Greg Smith (Alice Cooper, Alan Parsons). Hollywood manager Sandy Gallin[17] secured the team a recording contract with Victory/Polygram.[18] Director Paul Boyd filmed the music video for their initial radio single, "Miles Away."[19] Ric Wake produced their debut LP, Mirror for the Blame. The band performed the album's eponymous track on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, and toured in support of major recording acts including Bon Jovi, Paul Rodgers and Neal Schon. In 1992 Tonto Tonto's song "Real Today"[20] was featured in the slasher film Dr. Giggles, winner of the Special Jury Award[21] at the Avoriaz Fantastic Film Festival, as well as in the video game generated by the motion picture. In 1994 Tonto Tonto played at The White Nights Festival in St. Petersburg, Russia. Fowler and Wattenberg composed music for and acted in A Hit Is a Hit, the tenth episode of the HBO original series The Sopranos.[22] In 1995 their song “Sunday” was shortlisted for the International John Lennon Songwriting Contest.

In 1999 Fowler founded the hard rock band MOTHER with guitarist Arthur Lynn, aka A.L.L., and drummer Keith Carlock, (John Mayer, Steely Dan, Sting). MOTHER’s self-titled debut album was signed by Al Teller to Atomic Pop Records, the world's first internet recording label.[23] MOTHER placed music in the Sony Pictures Entertainment production Mercy.[24] Fowler's songs have also appeared in television series, such as "You Don't Remember,"[25] featured in 2010 on The CW Network’s 90210. His voice has been placed in national advertising jingles.[26] Fowler's southern rock ballad "Splinter," produced by Andrew Wyatt, was included in the 2011 motion picture Undocumented.

In 2010 Fowler formed the pomp-rock band Maximilian Is King with A.L.L. and keyboardist Rob Clores. Steve Thompson (musician) mixed their Music For The Fire EP, which was placed on rotation on Anything Anything with Rich Russo,[27] a program featured on[28] WRXP 101.9, New York City's then-largest rock radio station. Russo called Fowler's "the best pure voice in New York." Maximilian Is King's debut full-length, Songs To Kill Yourself With,[29] was produced by A.L.L. with drum programming by Carlos Alomar. The album was mixed with additional production by Roy Thomas Baker. In 2011 Fowler began performing live with Grammy Award-winning guitarist and songwriter Steve Stevens,[30][31] best known for collaboration with artists Billy Idol and Michael Jackson. At New York City's Iridium Jazz Club these sets featured the Les Paul Trio and drummers Anton Fig and Shawn Pelton.[32][33] In 2012 Fowler contributed vocals to DJ Riddler's extended mix "Hold On Me" featured on Riddler's debut studio album Enigma, released October 2, 2012 on Soltrenz/Strictly Rhythm Records.[34] In April 2013 Fowler performed the song "Sleep Walking" featured in Cutting Edge Group's motion picture The Right Kind of Wrong (film).[35] In 2013 Fowler's power ballad "Road to Somewhere" was a finalist in the rock category for the Song of the Year: Song and Lyric Writing Competition.[36] In October 2013 Fowler signed with 140 Records,[37] the first Twitter-based record label. In the same month he began a residency at Greenwich Village's Club Groove,[38] sister venue of the legendary Cafe Wha, where he performed a selection of funk, R&B, rock, Motown and soul. In February, 2014 three of Fowler's songs were announced as semifinalists in The International

Acknowledgments
[ix] As will be apparent to the reader, my thinking about nationalism has been deeply affected
by the writings of Erich Auerbach, Walter Benjamin and Victor Turner. In preparing the book
itself, I have benefitted enormously from the criticism and advice of my brother Perry
Anderson, Anthony Barnett, and Steve Heder. J. A. Ballard, Mohamed Chambas, Peter
Katzenstein, the late Rex Mortimer, Francis Mulhern, Tom Nairn, Shiraishi Takashi, Jim
Siegel, Laura Summers, and Esta Ungar also gave me invaluable help in different ways.
Naturally, none of these friendly critics should be held in any way accountable for the text's
deficiencies, which are wholly my responsibility. I should perhaps add that I am by training
and profession a specialist on Southeast Asia. This admission may help to explain some of
the book's biases and choices of examples, as well as to deflate its would-be-global
pretensions.

Walter Benjamin, Illuminations
Thus from a Mixture of all kinds began,
That Het'rogeneous Thing, An Englishman:
In eager Rapes, and furious Lust begot,
Betwixt a Painted Britton and a Scot:
Whose gend'ring Offspring quickly learnt to bow,
And yoke their Heifers to the Roman Plough:
From whence a Mongrel half-bred Race there came,
With neither Name nor Nation, Speech or Fame.
In whose hot Veins now Mixtures quickly ran,
Infus'd betwixt a Saxon and a Dane.
While their Rank Daughters, to their Parents just,
Receiv'd all Nations with Promiscuous Lust.
This Nauseous Brood directly did contain
The well-extracted Blood of Englishmen . . .

Preface to the Second Edition
[xi] Who would have thought that the storm blows harder the farther it leaves Paradise
behind?
The armed conflicts of 1978-79 in Indochina, which provided the immediate occasion for the
original text of Imagined Communities, seem already, a mere twelve years later, to belong to
another era. Then I was haunted by the prospect of further full-scale wars between the
socialist states. Now half these states have joined the debris at the Angel's feet, and the rest
are fearful of soon following them. The wars that the survivors face are civil wars. The
likelihood is strong that by the opening of the new millennium little will remain of the Union
of Soviet Socialist Republics except... republics.
Should all this have somehow been foreseen? In 1983 I wrote that the Soviet Union was 'as
much the legatee of the prenational dynastic states of the nineteenth century as the precursor
of a twenty-first century internationalist order.' But, having traced the nationalist explosions
that destroyed the vast polyglot and polyethnic realms which were ruled from Vienna,
London, Constantinople, Paris and Madrid, I could not see that the train was laid at least as
far as Moscow. It is melancholy consolation to observe that history seems to be bearing out
the 'logic' of Imagined Communities better than its author managed to do.
It is not only the world that has changed its face over the past [xii] twelve years. The study of
nationalism too has been startlingly transformed - in method, scale, sophistication, and sheer
quantity. In the English language alone, J. A. Armstrong's Nations Before Nationalism
(1982), John Breui\\y's Nationalism and the State (1982), Ernest Gellner's Nations and
Nationalism (1983), Miroslav Hroch's Social Preconditions of National Revival in Europe
(1985), Anthony Smith's The Ethnic Origins of Nations (1986), P. Chatterjee's Nationalist
Thought and the Colonial World (1986), and Eric Hobsbawm's Nations and Nationalism
since 1788 (1990)- to name only a few of the key texts-have, by their historical reach and
theoretical power, made largely obsolete the traditional literature on the subject. In part out of
these works has developed an extraordinary proliferation of historical, literary,
anthropological, sociological, feminist, and other studies linking the objects of these fields of
enquiry to nationalism and nation.1
To adapt Imagined Communities to the demands of these vast changes in the world and in the
text is a task beyond my present means. It seemed better, therefore, to leave it largely as an
'unrestored'period piece, with its own characteristic style, silhouette, and mood. Two things
give me comfort. On the one hand, the full final outcome of developments in the old socialist
world remain shrouded in the obscurity ahead. On the other hand, the idiosyncratic method
and preoccupations of Imagined Communities seem to me still on the margins of the newer
scholarship on nationalism-in that sense, at least, not fully superseded.
What I have tried to do, in the present edition, is simply to correct errors of fact, conception,
and interpretation which I should have avoided in preparing the original version. These
corrections - in the spirit of 1983, as it were -involve some alterations of the first edition, as
well as two new chapters, which basically have the character of discrete appendices.
In the main text, I discovered two serious errors of translation, at least one unfulfilled
promise, and one misleading emphasis. Unable to read Spanish in 1983, I thoughtlessly relied
on Leon Ma. Guerrero's English translation of Jose Rizal's Noli Me Tangere, although earlier
[xiii] translations were available. It was only in 1990 that I discovered how fascinatingly
corrupt Guerrero's version was. For a long, important quotation from Otto Bauer's Die
Nationalitätenfrage und die Sozial-demokratie I lazily relied on Oscar Jaszi's translation.
More recent consultation of the German original has shown me how far Jaszi's political
predilections tinted his citations. In at least two passages I had faithlessly promised to explain
why Brazilian nationalism developed so late and so idiosyncratically by comparison with
those of other Latin American countries. The present text attempts to fulfil the broken pledge.
It had been part of my original plan to stress the New World origins of nationalism. My
feeling had been that an unselfconscious provincialism had long skewed and distorted
theorizing on the subject. European scholars, accustomed to the conceit that everything
important in the modern world originated in Europe, too easily took 'second generation'
ethnolinguistic nationalisms (Hungarian, Czech, Greek, Polish, etc.) as the starting point in
their modelling, no matter whether they were 'for' or 'against' nationalism. I was startled to
discover, in many of the notices of Imagined Communities, that this Eurocentric
provincialism remained quite undisturbed, and that the crucial chapter on the originating
Americas was largely ignored. Unfortunately, I have found no better 'instant' solution to this
problem than to retitle Chapter 4 as 'Creole Pioneers.'
The two 'appendices' try to correct serious theoretical flaws in the first edition.2 A number of
friendly critics had suggested that Chapter 7 ('The Last Wave') oversimplified the process
whereby early 'Third World' nationalisms were modelled. Furthermore the chapter did not
seriously address the question of the role of the local colonial state, rather than the metropole,
in styling these nationalisms. At the same time, I became uneasily aware that what I had
believed to be a significantly new contribution to thinking about nationalism – [xiv] changing
apprehensions of time - patently lacked its necessary coordinate: changing apprehensions of
space. A brilliant doctoral thesis by Thongchai Winichakul, a young Thai historian,
stimulated me to think about mapping's contribution to the nationalist imagination.
'Census, Map, Museum' therefore analyses the way in which, quite unconsciously, the
nineteenth-century colonial state (and policies that its mindset encouraged) dialectically
engendered the grammar of the nationalisms that eventually arose to combat it. Indeed, one
might go so far as to say that the state imagined its local adversaries, as in an ominous
prophetic dream, well before they came into historical existence. To the forming of this
imagining, the census's abstract quantification/serialization of persons, the map's eventual
logoization of political space, and the museum's 'ecumenical,' profane genealogizing made
interlinked contributions.
The origin of the second 'appendix' was the humiliating recognition that in 1983 I had quoted
Renan without the slightest understanding of what he had actually said: I had taken as
something easily ironical what was in fact utterly bizarre. The humiliation also forced me to
realize that I had offered no intelligible explanation of exactly how, and why, new-emerging
nations imagined themselves antique. What appeared in most of the scholarly writings as
Machiavellian hocus-pocus, or as bourgeois fantasy, or as disinterred historical truth, struck
me now as deeper and more interesting. Supposing 'antiquity' were, at a certain historical
juncture, the necessary consequence of 'novelty?' If nationalism was, as I supposed it, the
expression of a radically changed form of consciousness, should not awareness of that break,
and the necessary forgetting of the older consciousness, create its own narrative? Seen from
this perspective, the atavistic fantasizing characteristic of most nationalist thought after the
1820s appears an epiphenomenon; what is really important is the structural alignment of post-
1820s nationalist 'memory' with the inner premises and conventions of modern biography and
autobiography.
Aside from any theoretical merits or demerits the two 'appendices' may prove to have, each
has its own more everyday limitations. The data for 'Census, Map, Museum' are drawn
wholly from Southeast Asia. In some ways this region offers splendid opportunities for [xv]
comparative theorizing since it comprises areas formerly colonized by almost all the great
imperial powers (England, France, Holland, Portugal, Spain and the United States) as well as
uncolonized Siam. Nonetheless, it remains to be seen whether my analysis, even if plausible
for this region, can be convincingly applied around the globe. In the second appendix, the
sketchy empirical material relates almost exclusively to Western Europe and the New World,
regions on which my knowledge is quite superficial. But the focus had to be there since it was
in these zones that the amnesias of nationalism were first voiced over.

1. Hobsbawm has had the courage to conclude from this scholarly explosion that the age of nationalism is near
its end: Minerva's owl flies at dusk.
2. The first appendix originated in a paper prepared for a conference held in Karachi in January 1989, sponsored
by the World Institute for Development Economics Research of the United Nations University. A sketch for the
second appeared in The Times Literary Supplement of June 13,1986, under the rubric 'Narrating the Nation.'
1. Introduction
[1] Perhaps without being much noticed yet, a fundamental transformation in the history of
Marxism and Marxist movements is upon us. Its most visible signs are the recent wars
between Vietnam, Cambodia and China. These wars are of world-historical importance
because they are the first to occur between regimes whose independence and revolutionary
credentials are undeniable, and because none of the belligerents has made more than the most
perfunctory attempts to justify the bloodshed in terms of a recognizable Marxist theoretical
perspective. While it was still just possible to interpret the Sino-Soviet border clashes of
1969, and the Soviet military interventions in Germany (1953), Hungary (1956),
Czechoslovakia (1968), and Afghanistan (1980) in terms of- according to taste - 'social
imperialism,' 'defending socialism,' etc., no one, I imagine, seriously believes that such
vocabularies have much bearing on what has occurred in Indochina.
If the Vietnamese invasion and occupation of Cambodia in December 1978 and January 1979
represented the first large-scale conventional war waged by one revolutionary Marxist
regime against another,1 China's assault on Vietnam in February rapidly confirmed [2] the
precedent. Only the most trusting would dare wager that in the declining years of this century
any significant outbreak of inter-state hostilities will necessarily find the USSR and the PRClet
alone the smaller socialist states - supporting, or fighting on, the same side. Who can be
confident that Yugoslavia and Albania will not one day come to blows? Those variegated
groups who seek a withdrawal of the Red Army from its encampments in Eastern Europe
should remind themselves of the degree to which its overwhelming presence has, since 1945,
ruled out armed conflict between the region's Marxist regimes.
Such considerations serve to underline the fact that since World War II every successful
revolution has defined itself in national terms-the People's Republic of China, the Socialist
Republic of Vietnam, and so forth - and, in so doing, has grounded itself firmly in a territorial
and social space inherited from the prerevolutionary past. Conversely, the fact that the Soviet
Union shares with the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland the rare
distinction of refusing nationality in its naming suggests that it is as much the legatee of the
prenational dynastic states of the nineteenth century as the precursor of a twenty-first century
internationalist order.2
Eric Hobsbawm is perfectly correct in stating that 'Marxist movements and states have tended
to become national not only in form but in substance, i.e., nationalist. There is nothing to
suggest [3] that this trend will not continue.'3 Nor is the tendency confined to the socialist
world. Almost every year the United Nations admits new members. And many 'old nations,'
once thought fully consolidated, I find themselves challenged by 'sub'-nationalisms within
their borders-nationalisms which, naturally, dream of shedding this sub-ness one happy day.
The reality is quite plain: the 'end of the era of nationalism,' so long prophesied, is not
remotely in sight. Indeed, nation-ness is the most universally legitimate value in the political
life of our time.
But if the facts are clear, their explanation remains a matter of long-standing dispute. Nation,
nationality, nationalism - all have proved notoriously difficult to define, let alone to analyse.
In contrast to the immense influence that nationalism has exerted on the modern world,
plausible theory about it is conspicuously meagre. Hugh Seton-Watson, author of far the best
and most comprehensive English-language text on nationalism, and heir to a vast tradition of
liberal historiography and social science, sadly observes: 'Thus I am driven to the conclusion
that no "scientific definition" of the nation can be devised; yet the phenomenon has existed
and exists.'4 Tom Nairn, author of the path-breaking The Break-up of Britain, and heir to the
scarcely less vast tradition of Marxist historiography and social science, candidly remarks:
'The theory of nationalism represents Marxism's great historical failure.'5 But even this
confession is somewhat misleading, insofar as it can be taken to imply the regrettable
outcome of a long, self-conscious search for theoretical clarity. It would be more exact to say
that nationalism has proved an uncomfortable anomaly for Marxist theory and, precisely for
that reason, has been largely elided, rather than confronted. How else to explain Marx's
failure to explicate the crucial adjective in his memorable formulation of 1848: 'The
proletariat of each country [4] must, of course, first of all settle matters with its own
bourgeoisie'?6 How else to account for the use, for over a century, of the concept 'national
bourgeoisie' without any serious attempt to justify theoretically the relevance of the
adjective? Why is this segmentation of the bourgeoisie - a world-class insofar as it is defined
in terms of the relations of production - theoretically significant?
The aim of this book is to offer some tentative suggestions for a more satisfactory
interpretation of the 'anomaly' of nationalism. My sense is that on this topic both Marxist and
liberal theory have become etiolated in a late Ptolemaic effort to 'save the phenomena'; and
that a reorientation of perspective in, as it were, a Copernican spirit is urgently required. My
point of departure is that nationality, or, as one might prefer to put it in view of that word's
multiple significations, nation-ness, as well as nationalism, are cultural artefacts of a
particular kind. To understand them properly we need to consider carefully how they have
come into historical being, in what ways their meanings have changed over time, and why,
today, they command such profound emotional legitimacy. I will be trying to argue that the
creation of these artefacts towards the end of the eighteenth century7 was the spontaneous
distillation of a complex 'crossing' of discrete historical forces; but that, once created, they
became 'modular,' capable of being transplanted, with varying degrees of self-consciousness,
to a great variety of social terrains, to merge and be merged with a correspondingly wide
variety of political and ideological constellations. I will also attempt to show why these
particular cultural artefacts have aroused such deep attachments.
CONCEPTS AND DEFINITIONS
[5] Before addressing the questions raised above, it seems advisable to consider briefly the
concept of 'nation' and offer a workable definition. Theorists of nationalism have often been
perplexed, not to say irritated, by these three paradoxes: (1) The objective modernity of
nations to the historian's eye vs. their subjective antiquity in the eyes of nationalists. (2) The
formal universality of nationality as a socio-cultural concept - in the modern world everyone
can, should, will 'have' a nationality, as he or she 'has' a gender-vs. the irremediable
particularity of its concrete manifestations, such that, by definition, 'Greek' nationality is sui
generis. (3) The 'political' power of nationalisms vs. their philosophical poverty and even
incoherence. In other words, unlike most other isms, nationalism has never produced its own
grand thinkers: no Hobbeses, Tocquevilles, Marxes, or Webers. This 'emptiness' easily gives
rise, among cosmopolitan and polylingual intellectuals, to a certain condescension. Like
Gertrude Stein in the face of Oakland, one can rather quickly conclude that there is 'no there
there'. It is characteristic that even so sympathetic a student of nationalism as Tom Nairn can
nonetheless write that: ' "Nationalism" is the pathology of modern developmental history, as
inescapable as "neurosis" in the individual, with much the same essential ambiguity attaching
to it, a similar built-in capacity for descent into dementia, rooted in the dilemmas of
helplessness thrust upon most of the world (the equivalent of infantilism for societies) and
largely incurable.'8
Part of the difficulty is that one tends unconsciously to hypostasize the existence of
Nationalism-with-a-big-N (rather as one might Age-with-a-capital-A) and then to classify 'it'
as an ideology. (Note that if everyone has an age, Age is merely an analytical expression.) It
would, I think, make things easier if one treated it as if it belonged with 'kinship' and
'religion', rather than with 'liberalism' or 'fascism'.
In an anthropological spirit, then, I propose the following [6] definition of the nation: it is an
imagined political community - and imagined as both inherently limited and sovereign.
It is imagined because the members of even the smallest nation will never know most of their
fellow-members, meet them, or even hear of them, yet in the minds of each lives the image of
their communion.9 Renan referred to this imagining in his suavely back-handed way when he
wrote that 'Or l'essence d'une nation est que tous les individus aient beaucoup de choses en
commun, et aussi que tous aient oublie bien des choses.'10 With a certain ferocity Gellner
makes a comparable point when he rules that 'Nationalism is not die awakening of nations to
self-consciousness: it invents nations where they do not exist.'11 The drawback to this
formulation, however, is that Gellner is so anxious to show that nationalism masquerades
under false pretences that he assimilates 'invention' to 'fabrication' and 'falsity', rather than to
'imagining' and 'creation'. In this way he implies that 'true' communities exist which can be
advantageously juxtaposed to nations. In fact, all communities larger than primordial villages
of face-to-face contact (and perhaps even these) are imagined. Communities are to be
distinguished, not by their falsity/genuineness, but by the style in which they are imagined.
Javanese villagers have always known that they are connected to people they have never
seen, but these ties were once imagined particularistically - as indefinitely stretchable nets of
kinship and clientship. Until quite recently, the Javanese language had no word meaning the
abstraction 'society.' We may today think of the French aristocracy of the ancien regime as a
class; but surely it was imagined [7] this way only very late.12 To the question 'Who is the
Comte de X?' the normal answer would have been, not 'a member of the aristocracy,' but 'the
lord of X,' 'the uncle of the Baronne de Y.'or 'a client of the Due de Z.'
The nation is imagined as limited because even the largest of them, encompassing perhaps a
billion living human beings, has finite, if elastic, boundaries, beyond which lie other nations.
No nation imagines itself coterminous with mankind. The most messianic nationalists do not
dream of a day when all the members of the human race will join their nation in the way that
it was possible, in certain epochs, for, say, Christians to dream of a wholly Christian planet.
It is imagined as sovereign because the concept was born in an age in which Enlightenment
and Revolution were destroying the legitimacy of the divinely-ordained, hierarchical dynastic
realm. Coming to maturity at a stage of human history when even the most devout adherents
of any universal religion were inescapably confronted with the living pluralism of such
religions, and the allomorphism between each faith's ontological claims and territorial stretch,
nations dream of being free, and, if under .God, directly so. The gage and emblem of this
freedom is the sovereign state.
Finally, it is imagined as a community, because, regardless of the actual inequality and
exploitation that may prevail in each, the nation is always conceived as a deep, horizontal
comradeship. Ultimately it is this fraternity that makes it possible, over the past two centuries,
for so many millions of people, not so much to kill, as willingly to die for such limited
imaginings.
These deaths bring us abruptly face to face with the central problem posed by nationalism:
what makes the shrunken imaginings of recent history (scarcely more than two centuries)
generate such colossal sacrifices? I believe that the beginnings of an answer lie in the cultural
roots of nationalism.
1. This formulation is chosen simply to emphasize the scale and the style of the fighting, not to assign blame. To
avoid possible misunderstanding, it should be said that the December 1978 invasion grew out of armed clashes
between partisans of the two revolutionary movements going back possibly as far as 1971. After April 1977,
border raids, initiated by the Cambodians, but quickly followed by the Vietnamese, grew in size and scope,
culminating in the major Vietnamese incursion of December 1977. None of these raids, however, aimed at
overthrowing enemy regimes or occupying large territories, nor were the numbers of troops involved
comparable to those deployed in December 1978. The controversy over the causes of the war is most
thoughtfully pursued in: Stephen P. Heder, 'The Kampuchean-Vietnamese Conflict,' in David W. P. Elliott, ed.,
The Third Indochina Conflict, pp. 21-67; Anthony Barnett, 'Inter-Communist Conflicts and Vietnam,' Bulletin of
Concerned Asian Scholars, 11:4 (October-December 1979), pp. 2-9; and Laura Summers, 'In Matters of War
and Socialism Anthony Barnett would Shame and Honour Kampuchea Too Much," ibid., pp. 10-18.

disputed except by nationalist ideologues in particular countries. Kemilainen also observes that the word
'nationalism' did not come into wide general use until the end of the nineteenth century. It did not occur, for
example, in many standard nineteenth century lexicons. If Adam Smith conjured with the wealth of'nations,' he
meant by the term no more than 'societies' or 'states.' Aira Kemilainen, Nationalism, pp. 10, 33, and 48-49.

imaginable under the ancien regime?
2. Cultural Roots
[9] No more arresting emblems of the modern culture of nationalism exist than cenotaphs and
tombs of Unknown Soldiers. The public ceremonial reverence accorded these monuments
precisely because they are either deliberately empty or no one knows who lies inside them,
has no true precedents in earlier times.1 To feel the force of this modernity one has only to
imagine the general reaction to the busybody who 'discovered' the Unknown Soldier's name
or insisted on filling the cenotaph with some real bones. Sacrilege of a strange, contemporary
kind! Yet void as these tombs are of identifiable mortal remains or immortal souls, they are
nonetheless saturated with ghostly national imaginings.2 (This is why so many different
nations [10] have such tombs without feeling any need to specify the nationality of their
absent occupants. What else could they be but Germans, Americans, Argentinians... ?)
The cultural significance of such monuments becomes even clearer if one tries to imagine,
say, a Tomb of the Unknown Marxist or a cenotaph for fallen Liberals. Is a sense of absurdity
avoidable? The reason is that neither Marxism nor Liberalism are much concerned with death
and immortality. If the nationalist imagining is so concerned, this suggests a strong affinity
with religious imaginings. As this affinity is by no means fortuitous, it may be useful to begin
a consideration of the cultural roots of nationalism with death, as the last of a whole gamut of
fatalities.
If the manner of a man's dying usually seems arbitrary, his mortality is inescapable. Human
lives are full of such combinations of necessity and chance. We are all aware of the
contingency and ineluctability of our particular genetic heritage, our gender, our life-era, our
physical capabilities, our mother-tongue, and so forth. The great merit of traditional religious
world-views (which naturally must be distinguished from their role in the legitimation of
specific systems of domination and exploitation) has been their concern with man-in-thecosmos,
man as species being, and the contingency of life. The extraordinary survival over
thousands of years of Buddhism, Christianity or Islam in dozens of different social
formations attests to their imaginative response to the overwhelming burden of human
suffering — disease, mutilation, grief, age, and death. Why was I born blind? Why is my best
friend paralysed? Why is my daughter retarded? The religions attempt to explain. The great
weakness of all evolutionary/progressive styles of thought, not excluding Marxism, is that
such questions are answered with impatient silence.3 At the [11] same time, in different ways,
religious thought also responds to obscure intimations of immortality, generally by
transforming fatality into continuity (karma, original sin, etc.) In this way, it concerns itself
with the links between the dead and the yet unborn, the mystery of re-generation. Who
experiences their child's conception and birth without dimly apprehending a combined connectedness,
fortuity, and fatality in a language of 'continuity'? (Again, the disadvantage of
evolutionary/progressive thought is an almost Heraclitean hostility to any idea of continuity.)
I bring up these perhaps simpleminded observations primarily because in Western Europe the
eighteenth century marks not only the dawn of the age of nationalism but the dusk of
religious modes of thought. The century of the Enlightenment, of rationalist secularism,
brought with it its own modern darkness. With the ebbing of religious belief, the suffering
which belief in part composed did not disappear. Disintegration of paradise: nothing makes
fatality more arbitrary. Absurdity of salvation: nothing makes another style of continuity
more necessary. What then was required was a secular transformation of fatality into
continuity, contingency into meaning. As we shall see, few things were (are) better suited to
this end than an idea of nation. If nation-states are widely conceded to be 'new' and
'historical,' the nations to which they give political expression always loom out of an
immemorial past,4 and, still more important, [12] glide into a limitless future. It is the magic
of nationalism to turn chance: jnto destiny. With Debray we might say, 'Yes, it is quite
accidental that I am born French; but after all, France is eternal.'
Needless to say, I am not claiming that the appearance of nationalism towards the end of the
eighteenth century was 'produced' by the erosion of religious certainties, or that this erosion
does not itself require a complex explanation. Nor am I suggesting that somehow nationalism
historically 'supersedes' religion. What I am proposing is that nationalism has to be
understood by aligning it, not with self-consciously held political ideologies, but with the
large cultural systems that preceded it, out of which-as well as against which-it came into
being.
For present purposes, the two relevant cultural systems are the religious community and the
dynastic realm. For both of these, in their heydays, were taken-for-granted frames of
reference, very much as nationality is today. It is therefore essential to consider what gave
these cultural systems their self-evident plausibility, and at the same time to underline certain
key elements in their decomposition.
THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY
Few things are more impressive than the vast territorial stretch of the Ummah Islam from
Morocco to the Sulu Archipelago, of Christendom from Paraguay to Japan, and of the
Buddhist world from Sri Lanka to the Korean peninsula. The great sacral cultures (and for
our purposes here it may be permissible to include 'Confucianism') incorporated conceptions
of immense communities. But Christendom, the Islamic Ummah, and even the Middle
Kingdom — which, though we think of it today as Chinese, imagined itself not as Chinese,
but as [13] central — were imaginable largely through the medium of a sacred language and
written script. Take only the example of Islam: if Maguindanao met Berbers in Mecca,
knowing nothing of each other's languages, incapable of communicating orally, they nonetheless
understood each other's ideographs, because the sacred texts they shared existed only
in classical Arabic. In this sense, written Arabic functioned like Chinese characters to create a
community out of signs, not sounds. (So today mathematical language continues an old
tradition. Of what the Thai call + Rumanians have no idea, and vice versa, but both
comprehend the symbol.) All the great classical communities conceived of themselves as
cosmically central, through the medium of a sacred language linked to a superterrestrial order
of power. Accordingly, the stretch of written Latin, Pali, Arabic, or Chinese was, in theory,
unlimited. (In fact, the deader the written language-the farther it was from speech-the better:
in principle everyone has access to a pure world of signs.)
Yet such classical communities linked by sacred languages had a character distinct from the
imagined communities of modern nations. One crucial difference was the older communities'
confidence in the unique sacredness of their languages, and thus their ideas about admission
to membership. Chinese mandarins looked with approval on barbarians who painfully learned
to paint Middle Kingdom ideograms. These barbarians were already halfway to full
absorption.5 Half-civilized was vastly better than barbarian. Such an attitude was certainly not
peculiar to the Chinese, nor confined to antiquity. Consider, for example, the following
'policy on barbarians'formulated by the early-nineteenth-century Colombian liberal Pedro
Fermin de Vargas:
To expand our agriculture it would be necessary to hispanicize our Indians. Their idleness,
stupidity, and indifference towards normal endeavours causes one to think that they come from a
degenerate race which deteriorates in proportion to the distance from its origin ... it would be very
desirable that the Indians be extinguished, by miscegenation with [14] the whites, declaring them
free of tribute and other charges, and giving them private property in land.6
How striking it is that this liberal still proposes to 'extinguish' his Indians in part by 'declaring
them free of tribute' and 'giving them private property in land', rather than exterminating them
by gun and microbe as his heirs in Brazil, Argentina, and the United States began to do soon
afterwards. Note also, alongside the condescending cruelty, a cosmic optimism: the Indian is
ultimately redeemable - by impregnation with white, 'civilized' semen, and the acquisition of
private property, like everyone else. (How different Fermin's attitude is from the later
European imperialist's preference for 'genuine' Malays, Gurkhas, and Hausas over 'halfbreeds,'
'semi-educated natives,' 'wogs', and the like.)
Yet if the sacred silent languages were the media through which the great global communities
of the past were imagined, the reality of such apparitions depended on an idea largely foreign
to the contemporary Western mind: the non-arbitrariness of the sign. The ideograms of
Chinese, Latin, or Arabic were emanations of reality, not randomly fabricated representations
of it. We are familiar with the long dispute over the appropriate language (Latin or
vernacular) for the mass. In the Islamic tradition, until quite recently, the Qur'an was literally
untranslatable (and therefore untranslated), because Allah's truth was accessible only through
the unsubstitutable true signs of written Arabic. There is no idea here of a world so separated
from language that all languages are equidistant (and thus interchangeable) signs for it. In
effect, ontological reality is apprehensible only through a single, privileged system of representation:
the truth-language of Church Latin, Qur'anic Arabic, or Examination Chinese.7
And, as truth-languages, imbued with an impulse largely foreign to [15] nationalism, the
impulse towards conversion. By conversion, I mean not so much the acceptance of particular
religious tenets, but alchemic absorption. The barbarian becomes 'Middle Kingdom', the Rif
Muslim, the Ilongo Christian. The whole nature of man's being is sacrally malleable.
(Contrast thus the prestige of these old world-languages, towering high over all vernaculars,
with Esperanto or Volapiik, which lie ignored between them.) It was, after all, this possibility
of conversion through the sacred language that made it possible for an 'Englishman' to
become Pope8 and a 'Manchu' Son of Heaven.
But even though the sacred languages made such communities as Christendom imaginable,
the actual scope and plausibility of these communities can not be explained by sacred script
alone: their readers were, after all, tiny literate reefs on top of vast illiterate oceans.9 A fuller
explanation requires a glance at the relationship between the literati and their societies. It
would be a mistake to view the former as a kind of theological technocracy. The languages
they sustained, if abstruse, had none of the self-arranged abstruseness of lawyers' or
economists'jargons, on the margin of society's idea of reality. Rather, the literati were adepts,
strategic strata in a cosmological hierarchy of which the apex was divine.10 The fundamental
conceptions about 'social groups' were centripetal and hierarchical, rather than boundaryoriented
and horizontal. The astonishing power of the papacy in its noonday is only
comprehensible in terms of a trans-European Latin-writing clerisy, and a conception of the
world, shared by virtually everyone, that the bilingual intelligentsia, by mediating between
vernacular and Latin, mediated [16] between earth and heaven. (The awesomeness of
excommunication reflects this cosmology.)
Yet for all the grandeur and power of the great religiously imagined communities, their
tinsel/conscious coherence waned steadily after the late Middle Ages. Among the reasons for
this decline, I wish here to emphasize only the two which are directly related to these
communities' unique sacredness.
First was the effect of the explorations of the non-European world, which mainly but by no
means exclusively in Europe 'abruptly widened the cultural and geographic horizon and
hence also men's conception of possible forms of human life.'11 The process is already
apparent in the greatest of all European travel-books. Consider the following awed
description of Kublai Khan by the good Venetian Christian Marco Polo at the end of the
thirteenth century:12
The grand khan, having obtained this signal victory, returned with great pomp and triumph to the
capital city of Kanbalu. This took place in the month of November, and he continued to reside
there during the months of February and March, in which latter was our festival of Easter. Being
aware that this was one of our principal solemnities, he commanded all the Christians to attend
him, and to bring with them their Book, which contains the four Gospels of the Evangelists. After
causing it to be repeatedly perfumed with incense, in a ceremonious manner, he devoutly kissed it,
and directed that the same should be done by all his nobles who were present. This was his usual
practice upon each of the principal Christian festivals, such as Easter and Christmas; and he
observed the same at the festivals of the Saracens, Jews, and idolaters. Upon being asked his
motive for this conduct, he said: 'There are four great Prophets who are reverenced and worshipped
by the different classes of mankind. The Christians regard Jesus Christ as their divinity; the
Saracens, Mahomet; the Jews, Moses; and the idolaters, Sogomombar-kan, the most eminent
among their idols. I do honour and show respect to all the four, and invoke to my aid whichever
amongst them is in truth supreme in heaven.' But from the [17] manner in which his majesty acted
towards them, it is evident that he regarded the faith of the Christians as the truest and the best...
What is so remarkable about this passage is not so much the great Mongol dynast's calm
religious relativism (it is still a religious relativism), as Marco Polo's attitude and language. It
never occurs to him, even though he is writing for fellow-European Christians, to term Kublai
a hypocrite or an idolater. (No doubt in part because 'in respect to number of subjects, extent
of territory, and amount of revenue, he surpasses every sovereign that has heretofore been or
that now is in the world. ')13 And in the unselfconscious use of 'our' (which becomes 'their'),
and the description of the faith of the Christians as 'truest,' rather than 'true,' we can detect the
seeds of a territorializa-tion of faiths which foreshadows the language of many nationalists
('our' nation is 'the best'-in a competitive, comparative field).
What a revealing contrast is provided by the opening of the letter written by the Persian
traveller 'Rica'tohis friend 'Ibben'from Paris in '1712':14
The Pope is the chief of the Christians; he is an ancient idol, worshipped now from habit. Once he
was formidable even to princes, for he would depose them as easily as our magnificent sultans
depose the kings of Iremetia or Georgia. But nobody fears him any longer. He claims to be the
successor of one of the earliest Christians, called Saint Peter, and it is certainly a rich succession,
for his treasure is immense and he has a great country under his control.
The deliberate, sophisticated fabrications of the eighteenth century Catholic mirror the naive
realism of his thirteenth-century predecessor, but by now the 'relativization' and
'territorialization' are utterly selfconscious, and political in intent. Is it unreasonable to see a
paradoxical elaboration of this evolving tradition in the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's
identification of The Great Satan, not as a [18] heresy, nor even as a demonic personage (dim
little Carter scarcely fitted the bill), but as a nation'?
Second was a gradual demotion of the sacred language itself. Writing of mediaeval Western
Europe, Bloch noted that 'Latin was not only the language in which teaching was done, it was
the only language taught.’ 15 (This second 'only' shows quite clearly the sacredness of Latin
— no other language was thought worth the teaching.) But by the sixteenth century all this
was changing fast. The reasons for the change need not detain us here: the central importance
of print-capitalism will be discussed below. It is sufficient to remind ourselves of its scale and
pace. Febvre and Martin estimate that 77% of the books printed before 1500 were still in
Latin (meaning nonetheless that 23% were already in vernaculars).16 If of the 88 editions
printed in Paris in 1501 all but 8 were in Latin, after 1575 a majority were always in French.17
Despite a temporary come-back during the Counter-Reformation, Latin's hegemony was
doomed. Nor are we speaking simply of a general popularity. Somewhat later, but at no less
dizzying speed, Latin ceased to be the language of a pan-European high intelligentsia. In the
seventeenth century Hobbes (1588-1678) was a figure of continental renown because he
wrote in the truth-language. Shakespeare (1564-1616), on the other hand, composing in the
vernacular, was virtually unknown across the Channel.18 And had English not become, two
hundred years later, the pre-eminent world-imperial language, might he not largely have
retained his original insular obscurity? Meanwhile, these men's cross-Channel nearcontemporaries,
Descartes (1596-1650) and Pascal (1623-1662) conducted most of their
correspondence in Latin; but virtually all of Voltaire's (1694-1778) was in the vernacular.19
'After 1640, with fewer and fewer books coming out in Latin, and more and more in the
vernacular languages, publishing was ceasing to be an [19] international [sic] enterprise.' 20 In
a word, the fall of Latin exemplified a larger process in which the sacred communities
integrated by old sacred languages were gradually fragmented, pluralized, and territorialized.
THE DYNASTIC REALM
These days it is perhaps difficult to put oneself empathetically into a world in which the
dynastic realm appeared for most men as the only imaginable 'political' system. For in
fundamental ways 'serious' monarchy lies transverse to all modern conceptions of political
life. Kingship organizes everything around a high centre. Its legitimacy derives from divinity,
not from populations, who, after all, are subjects, not citizens. In the modern conception, state
sovereignty is fully, flatly, and evenly operative over each square centimetre of a legally
demarcated territory. But in the older imagining, where states were defined by centres,
borders were porous and indistinct, and sovereignties faded imperceptibly into one another.21
Hence, paradoxically enough, the ease with which pre-modern empires and kingdoms were
able to sustain their rule over immensely heterogeneous, and often not even contiguous,
populations for long periods of time.22
[20] One must also remember that these antique monarchical states expanded not only by
warfare but by sexual politics — of a kind very different from that practised today. Through
the general principle of verticality, dynastic marriages brought together diverse populations
under new apices. Paradigmatic in this respect was the House of Habsburg. As the tag went,
Bella gerant alii tu felix Austria nube! Here, in somewhat abbreviated form, is the later
dynasts' titulature.23
Emperor of Austria; King of Hungary, of Bohemia, of Dalmatia, Croatia, Slavonia, Galicia,
Lodomeria, and Illyria; King of Jerusalem, etc; Archduke of Austria [sic]; Grand Duke of Tuscany
and Cracow; Duke of Loth [a] ringia, of Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola, and Bukovina;
Grand Duke of Transylvania, Margrave of Moravia; Duke of Upper and Lower Silesia, of Modena,
Parma, Piacenza, and Guastella, of Ausschwitz and Sator, of Teschen, Friaul, Ragusa, and Zara;
Princely Count of Habsburg and Tyrol, of Kyburg, Gorz, and Gradiska; Duke of Trient and Brizen;
Margrave of Upper and Lower Lausitz and in Istria; Count of Hohenembs, Feldkirch, Bregenz,
Sonnenberg, etc.; Lord of Trieste, of Cattaro, and above the Windisch Mark; Great Voyvod of the
Voyvodina, Servia.... etc.
This, Jaszi justly observes, was, 'not without a certain comic aspect... the record of the
innumerable marriages, hucksterings and captures of the Habsburgs.'
In realms where polygyny was religiously sanctioned, complex systems of tiered concubinage
were essential to the integration of the realm. In fact, royal lineages often derived their
prestige, aside from any aura of divinity, from, shall we say, miscegenation?24 For such [21]
mixtures were signs of a superordinate status. It is characteristic that there has not been an
'English' dynasty ruling in London since the eleventh century (if then); and what 'nationality'
are we to assign to the Bourbons?25
During the seventeenth century, however - for reasons that need not detain us here - the
automatic legitimacy of sacral monarchy began its slow decline in Western Europe. In 1649,
Charles Stuart was beheaded in the first of the modern world's revolutions, and during the
1650s one of the more important European states was ruled by a plebeian Protector rather
than a king. Yet even in the age of Pope and Addison, Anne Stuart was still healing the sick
by the laying on of royal hands, cures committed also by the Bourbons, Louis XV and XVI,
in Enlightened France till the end of the ancien regime.26 But after 1789 the principle of
Legitimacy had to be loudly and selfconsciously defended, and, in the process,
'monarchy'became a semi-standardized model. Tenn5 and Son of Heaven became 'Emperors.'
In far-off Siam Rama V (Chulalongkorn) sent his sons and nephews to the courts of St.
Petersburg, London and Berlin to learn the intricacies of the world-model. In 1887, he
instituted the requisite principle of succession-by-legal-primogeniture, thus bringing Siam
'into line with the "civilized" monarchies of Europe.'27 The new system brought to the throne
in 1910 an erratic homosexual who would certainly have been passed over in an earlier age.
However, inter-monarchic approval of his ascension as Rama VI was sealed by the
attendance at his coronation of princelings from Britain, Russia, Greece, Sweden, Denmark
— and Japan!28
[22] As late as 1914, dynastic states made up the majority of the membership of the world
political system, but, as we shall be noting in detail below, many dynasts had for some time
been reaching for a 'national' cachet as the old principle of Legitimacy withered silently
away. While the armies of Frederick the Great (r. 1740-1786) were heavily staffed by
'foreigners', those of his great-nephew Friedrich Wilhelm III (r. 1797-1840) were, as a result
of Scharnhorst's, Gneisenau's and Clausewitz's spectacular reforms, exclusively 'national-
Prussian. '29
APPREHENSIONS OF TIME
It would be short-sighted, however, to think of the imagined communities of nations as
simply growing out of and replacing religious communities and dynastic realms. Beneath the
decline of sacred communities, languages and lineages, a fundamental change was taking
place in modes of apprehending the world, which, more than anything else, made it possible
to 'think' the nation.
To get a feeling for this change, one can profitably turn to the visual representations of the
sacred communities, such as the reliefs and stained-glass windows of mediaeval churches, or
the paintings of early Italian and Flemish masters. A characteristic feature of such
representations is something misleadingly analogous to 'modern dress'. The shepherds who
have followed the star to the manger where Christ is born bear the features of Burgundian
peasants. The Virgin Mary is figured as a Tuscan merchant's daughter. In many paintings the
commissioning patron, in full burgher or noble costume, appears kneeling in adoration
alongside the shepherds. What seems incongruous today obviously appeared wholly natural
to the eyes of mediaeval worshippers. We are faced with a world in [23] which the figuring of
imagined reality was overwhelmingly visual and aural. Christendom assumed its universal
form through a myriad of specificities and particularities: this relief, that window, this
sermon, that tale, this morality play, that relic. While the trans-European Latin-reading clerisy
was one essential element in the structuring of the Christian imagination, the mediation of its
conceptions to the illiterate masses, by visual and aural creations, always personal and
particular, was no less vital. The humble parish priest, whose forebears and frailties everyone
who heard his celebrations knew, was still the direct intermediary between his parishioners
and the divine. This juxtaposition of the cosmic-universal and the mundane-particular meant
that however vast Christendom might be, and was sensed to be, it manifested itself variously
to particular Swabian or Andalusian communities as replications of themselves. Figuring the
Virgin Mary with 'Semitic' features or 'first-century' costumes in the restoring spirit of the
modern museum was unimaginable because the mediaeval Christian mind had no conception
of history as an endless chain of cause and effect or of radical separations between past and
present.30 Bloch observes that people thought they must be near the end of time, in the sense
that Christ's second coming could occur at any moment: St. Paul had said that 'the day of the
Lord cometh like a thief in the night.' It was thus natural for the great twelfth-century
chronicler Bishop Otto of Freising to refer repeatedly to 'we who have been placed at the end
of time.' Bloch concludes that as soon as mediaeval men 'gave themselves up to meditation,
nothing was farther from their thoughts than the prospect of a long future for a young and
vigorous human race.'31
Auerbach gives an unforgettable sketch of this form of consciousness:32
[24] If an occurrence like the sacrifice of Isaac is interpreted as prefiguring the sacrifice of Christ,
so that in the former the latter is as it were announced and promised and the latter 'fulfills'... the
former, then a connection is established between two events which are linked neither temporally
nor causally-a connection which it is impossible to establish by reason in the horizontal dimension
... It can be established only if both occurrences are vertically linked to Divine Providence, which
alone is able to devise such a plan of history and supply the key to its understanding ... the here and
now is no longer a mere link in an earthly chain of events, it is simultaneously something which
has always been, and will be fulfilled in the future; and strictly, in the eyes of God, it is something
eternal, something omnitemporal, something already consummated in the realm of fragmentary
earthly event.
He rightly stresses that such an idea of simultaneity is wholly alien to our own. It views time
as something close to what Benjamin calls Messianic time, a simultaneity of past and future
in an instantaneous present.33 In such a view of things, the word 'meanwhile' cannot be of real
significance.
Our own conception of simultaneity has been a long time in the making, and its emergence is
certainly connected, in ways that have yet to be well studied, with the development of the
secular sciences. But it is a conception of such fundamental importance that, without taking it
fully into account, we will find it difficult to probe the obscure genesis of nationalism. What
has come to take the place of the mediaeval conception of simultaneity-along-time is, to
borrow again from Benjamin, an idea of 'homogeneous, empty time,' in which simultaneity is,
as it were, transverse, cross-time, marked not by prefiguring and fulfilment, but by temporal
coincidence, and measured by clock and calendar.34
Why this transformation should be so important for the birth of the imagined community of
the nation can best be seen if we consider the basic structure of two forms of imagining which
first flowered in [25] Europe in the eighteenth century: the novel and the newspaper.35 For
these forms provided the technical means for 're-presenting' the kind of imagined community
that is the nation.
Consider first the structure of the old-fashioned novel, a structure typical not only of the
masterpieces of Balzac but also of any contemporary dollar-dreadful. It is clearly a device for
the presentation of simultaneity in 'homogeneous, empty time,' or a complex gloss upon the
word 'meanwhile'. Take, for illustrative purposes, a segment of a simple novel-plot, in which
a man (A) has a wife (B) and a mistress (C), who in turn has a lover (D). We might imagine a
sort of time-chart for this segment as follows:
Time: I II III
Events: A quarrels with B A telephones C D gets drunk in a bar
C and D make love B shops A dines at home with B
D plays pool C has an ominous dream
Notice that during this sequence A and D never meet, indeed may not even be aware of each
other's existence if C has played her cards right.36 What then actually links A to D? Two
complementary conceptions: First, that they are embedded in 'societies' (Wessex, Liibeck,
Los Angeles). These societies are sociological entities of such firm and stable reality that
their members (A and D) can even be described as passing each other on the street, without
ever becoming acquainted, and still be connected.37 Second, that A and D are [26] embedded
in the minds of the omniscient readers. Only they, like God, watch A telephoning C, B
shopping, and D playing pool all at once. That all these acts are performed at the same
clocked, calendrical time, but by actors who may be largely unaware of one another, shows
the novelty of this imagined world conjured up by the author in his readers' minds.38
The idea of a sociological organism moving calendrically through homogeneous, empty time
is a precise analogue of the idea of the nation, which also is conceived as a solid community
moving steadily down (or up) history.39 An American will never meet, or even know the
names of more than a handful of his 240,000-odd fellow-Americans. He has no idea of what
they are up to at any one time. But he has complete confidence in their steady, anonymous,
simultaneous activity.
The perspective I am suggesting will perhaps seem less abstract if we turn to inspect briefly
four fictions from different cultures and different epochs, all but one of which, nonetheless,
are inextricably bound to nationalist movements. In 1887, the 'Father of Filipino
Nationalism', Jose Rizal, wrote the novel Noli Me Tangere, which today is regarded as the
greatest achievement of modern Filipino literature. It was also almost the first novel written
by an 'Indio.'40 Here is how it marvellously begins:41
Towards the end of October, Don Santiago de los Santos, popularly known as Capitan Tiago, was
giving a dinner party. Although, [27] contrary to his usual practice, he had announced it only that
afternoon, it was already the subject of every conversation in Binondo, in other quarters of the city,
and even in [the walled inner city of] Intramuros. In those days Capitan Tiago had the reputation of
a lavish host. It was known that his house, like his country, closed its doors to nothing, except to
commerce and to any new or daring idea.
So the news coursed like an electric shock through the community of parasites, spongers, and
gatecrashers whom God, in His infinite goodness, created, and so tenderly multiplies in Manila.
Some hunted polish for their boots, others looked for collar-buttons and cravats. But one and all
were preoccupied with the problem of how to greet their host with the familiarity required to create
the appearance of longstanding friendship, or, if need be, to excuse themselves for not having
arrived earlier.
The dinner was being given at a house on Anloague Street. Since we do not recall the street
number, we shall describe it in such a way that it may still be recognized - that is, if earthquakes
have not yet destroyed it. We do not believe that its owner will have had it torn down, since such
work is usually left to God or to Nature, which, besides, holds many contracts with our
Government.
Extensive comment is surely unnecessary. It should suffice to note that right from the start
the image (wholly new to Filipino writing) of a dinner-party being discussed by hundreds of
unnamed people, who do not know each other, in quite different parts of Manila, in a
particular month of a particular decade, immediately conjures up the imagined community.
And in the phrase 'a house on Anloague Street" which 'we shall describe in such a way that it
may still be recognized,' the would-be recognizers are we-Filipino-readers. The casual progression
of this house from the 'interior' time of the novel to the 'exterior' time of the [Manila]
reader's everyday life gives a hypnotic confirmation of the solidity of a single community,
embracing characters, author and readers, moving onward through calendrical time.42 Notice
too the tone. While Rizal has not the faintest idea of his [28] readers' individual identities, he
writes to them with an ironical intimacy, as though their relationships with each other are not
in the smallest degree problematic.43
Nothing gives one a more Foucauldian sense of abrupt discontinuities of consciousness than
to compare Noli with the most celebrated previous literary work by an 'Indio', Francisco
Balagtas (Baltazar)'s Pinagdaanang Buhay ni Florante at ni Laura sa Cahariang Albania
[The Story of Florante and Laura in the Kingdom of Albania], the first printed edition of
which dates from 1861, though it may have been composed as early as 1838.44 For although
Balagtas was still alive when Rizal was born, the world of his masterpiece is in every basic
respect foreign to that of Noli. Its setting — a fabulous mediaeval Albania — is utterly
removed in time and space from the Binondo of the 1880s. Its heroes — Florante, a Christian
Albanian nobleman, and his bosom-friend Aladin, a Muslim ('Moro') Persian aristocrat —
remind us of the Philippines only by the Christian-Moro linkage. Where Rizal deliberately
sprinkles his Spanish prose with Tagalog words for 'realistic', satirical, or nationalist effect,
Balagtas unselfconsciously mixes Spanish phrases into his Tagalog quatrains simply to
heighten the grandeur and sonority of his diction. Noli was meant to be read, while Florante
at Laura was to be sung aloud. Most striking of all is Balagtas's handling of time. As
Lumbera notes, 'the unravelling of the plot does not follow a chronological order. The story
begins in medias res, so that the complete story comes to us through a series of speeches that
serve as flashbacks.'45 Almost half of the 399 quatrains are accounts of Florante's childhood,
student years in Athens, and subsequent military exploits, given by the hero in conversation
with [29] Aladin.46 The 'spoken flashback' was for Balagtas the only alternative to a
straightforward single-file narrative. If we learn of Florante's and Aladin's 'simultaneous'
pasts, they are connected by their conversing voices, not by the structure of the epic. How
distant this technique is from that of the novel: 'In that same spring, while Florante was still
studying in Athens, Aladin was expelled from his sovereign's court...' In effect, it never
occurs to Balagtas to 'situate' his protagonists in 'society,' or to discuss them with his
audience. Nor, aside from the mellifluous flow of Tagalog polysyllables, is there much
'Filipino' about his text.47
In 1816, seventy years before the writing of Noli, Jose Joaquin Fernandez de Lizardi wrote a
novel called El Periquillo Sarniento [The Itching Parrot], evidently the first Latin American
work in this genre. In the words of one critic, this text is 'a ferocious indictment of Spanish
administration in Mexico: ignorance, superstition and corruption are seen to be its most
notable characteristics.'48 The essential form of this 'nationalist' novel is indicated by the
following description of its content:49
From the first, [the hero, the Itching Parrot] is exposed to bad influences - ignorant maids inculcate
superstitions, his mother indulges his whims, his teachers either have no vocation or no ability to
[30] discipline him. And though his father is an intelligent man who wants his son to practise a
useful trade rather than swell the ranks of lawyers and parasites, it is Periquillo's over-fond mother
who wins the day, sends her son to university and thus ensures that he will learn only superstitious
nonsense ... Periquillo remains incorrigibly ignorant despite many encounters with good and wise
people. He is unwilling to work or take anything seriously and becomes successively a priest, a
gambler, a thief, apprentice to an apothecary, a doctor, clerk in a provincial town ... These episodes
permit the author to describe hospitals, prisons, remote villages, monasteries, while at the same
time driving home one major point- that Spanish government and the education system encourage
parasitism and laziness... Periquillo's adventures several times take him among Indians and
Negroes...
Here again we see the 'national imagination' at work in the movement of a solitary hero
through a sociological landscape of a fixity that fuses the world inside the novel with the
world outside. This picaresque tour d'horison - hospitals, prisons, remote villages,
monasteries, Indians, Negroes - is nonetheless not a tourdu monde. The horizon is clearly
bounded: it is that of colonial Mexico. Nothing assures us of this sociological solidity more
than the succession of plurals. For they conjure up a social space full of comparable prisons,
none in itself of any unique importance, but all representative (in their simultaneous, separate
existence) of the oppressiveness of this colony.50 (Contrast prisons in the Bible. They are
never imagined as typical of this or that society. Each, like the one where Salome was
bewitched by John the Baptist, is magically alone.)
Finally, to remove the possibility that, since Rizal and Lizardi both wrote in Spanish, the
frameworks we have been studying are somehow 'European', here is the opening of
Semarang Hitam [Black Semarang], a tale by the ill-fated young Indonesian communistnationalist
Mas Marco Kartodikromo,51 published serially in 1924:52
[31] It was 7o 'clock, Saturday evening; young people in Semarang never stayed at home on
Saturday night. On this night however nobody was about. Because the heavy day-long rain had
made the roads wet and very slippery, all had stayed at home.
For the workers in shops and offices Saturday morning was a time of anticipation - anticipating
their leisure and the fun of walking around the city in the evening, but on this night they were to be
disappointed - because of lethargy caused by the bad weather and the sticky roads in the
kampungs. The main roads usually crammed with all sorts of traffic, the footpaths usually teeming
with people, all were deserted. Now and then the crack of a horse-cab's whip could be heard
spurring a horse on its way - or the clip-clop of horses' hooves pulling carriages along.
Semarang was deserted. The light from the rows of gas lamps shone straight down on the shining
asphalt road. Occasionally the clear light from the gas lamps was dimmed as the wind blew from
the east....
A young man was seated on a long rattan lounge reading a newspaper. He was totally engrossed.
His occasional anger and at other times smiles were a sure sign of his deep interest in the story. He
turned the pages of the newspaper, thinking that perhaps he could find something that would stop
him feeling so miserable. All of a sudden he came upon an article entitled:
PROSPERITY
A destitute vagrant became ill
and died on the side of the road from exposure.
The young man was moved by this brief report. He could just imagine the suffering of the poor
soul as he lay dying on the side of the road ... One moment he felt an explosive anger well up
inside. Another moment he felt pity. Yet another moment his anger was directed at [32] the social
system which gave rise to such poverty, while making a small group of people wealthy.
Here, as in El Periquillo Sarniento, we are in a world of plurals: shops, offices, carriages,
kampungs, and gas lamps. As in the case of Noli, we-the-Indonesian-readers are plunged
immediately into calendrical time and a familiar landscape; some of us may well have walked
those 'sticky' Semarang roads. Once again, a solitary hero is juxtaposed to a socioscape
described in careful, general detail. But there is also something new: a hero who is never
named, but who is frequently referred to as 'our young man'. Precisely the clumsiness and
literary naivety of the text confirm the unselfconscious 'sincerity' of this pronominal
adjective. Neither Marco nor his readers have any doubts about the reference. If in the
jocular-sophisticated fiction of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century Europe the trope 'our hero'
merely underlines an authorial play with a(ny) reader, Marco's 'our young man,' not least in
its novelty, means a young man who belongs to the collective body of readers of Indonesian,
and thus, implicitly, an embryonic Indonesian 'imagined community.' Notice that Marco feels
no need to specify this community by name: it is already there. (Even if polylingual Dutch
colonial censors could join his readership, they are excluded from this 'ourness,' as can be
seen from the fact that the young man's anger is directed at 'the,' not 'our,' social system.)
Finally, the imagined community is confirmed by the doubleness of our reading about our
young man reading. He does not find the corpse of the destitute vagrant by the side of a sticky
Semarang road, but imagines it from the print in a newspaper.53 Nor does he care the slightest
who the dead vagrant individually was: he thinks of the representative body, not the personal
life.
It is fitting that in Semarang Hitam a newspaper appears embedded [33] in fiction, for, if we
now turn to the newspaper as cultural product, we will be struck by its profound fictiveness.
What is the essential literary convention of the newspaper? If we were to look at a sample
front page of, say, The New York Times, we might find there stories about Soviet dissidents,
famine in Mali, a gruesome murder, a coup in Iraq, the discovery of a rare fossil in
Zimbabwe, and a speech by Mitterrand. Why are these events so juxtaposed? What connects
them to each other? Not sheer caprice. Yet obviously most of them happen independently,
without the actors being aware of each other or of what the others are up to. The arbitrariness
of their inclusion and juxtaposition (a later edition will substitute a baseball triumph for
Mitterrand) shows that the linkage between them is imagined.
This imagined linkage derives from two obliquely related sources. The first is simply
calendrical coincidence. The date at the top of the newspaper, the single most important
emblem on it, provides the essential connection - the steady onward clocking of
homogeneous, empty time.54 Within that time, 'the world' ambles sturdily ahead. The sign for
this: if Mali disappears from the pages of The New York Times after two days of famine
reportage, for months on end, readers do not for a moment imagine that Mali has disappeared
or that famine has wiped out all its citizens. The novelistic format of the newspaper assures
them that somewhere out there the 'character' Mali moves along quietly, awaiting its next
reappearance in the plot.
The second source of imagined-linkage lies in the relationship between the newspaper, as a
form of book, and the market. It has been estimated that in the 40-odd years between the
publication of the Gutenberg Bible and the close of the fifteenth century, more than
20,000,000 printed volumes were produced in Europe.55 Between 1500 and 1600, the number
manufactured had reached between [34] 150,000,000 and 200,000,000.56 'From early on... the
printing shops looked more like modern workshops than the monastic workrooms of the
Middle Ages. In 1455, Fust and Schoeffer were already running a business geared to
standardised production, and twenty years later large printing concerns were operating
everywhere in all [sic] Europe.'57 In a rather special sense, the book was the first modern-style
mass-produced industrial commodity.58 The sense I have in mind can be shown if we
compare the book to other early industrial products, such as textiles, bricks, or sugar. For
these commodities are measured in mathematical amounts (pounds or loads or pieces). A
pound of sugar is simply a quantity, a convenient load, not an object in itself. The book,
however-and here it prefigures the durables of our time - is a distinct, self-contained object,
exactly reproduced on a large scale.59 One pound of sugar flows into the next; each book has
its own eremitic self-sufficiency. (Small wonder that libraries, personal collections of massproduced
commodities, were already a familiar sight, in urban centres like Paris, by the
sixteenth century.)60
In this perspective, the newspaper is merely an 'extreme form' of the book, a book sold on a
colossal scale, but of ephemeral popularity. [35] Might we say: one-day best-sellers?61 The
obsolescence of the newspaper on the morrow of its printing - curious that one of the earlier
mass-produced commodities should so prefigure the inbuilt obsolescence of modern
durables-nonetheless, for just this reason, creates this extraordinary mass ceremony: the
almost precisely simultaneous consumption ('imagining') of the newspaper-as-fiction. We
know that particular morning and evening editions will overwhelmingly be consumed
between this hour and that, only on this day, not that. (Contrast sugar, the use of which
proceeds in an unclocked, continuous flow; it may go bad, but it does not go out of date.) The
significance of this mass ceremony - Hegel observed that newspapers serve modern man as a
substitute for morning prayers - is paradoxical. It is performed in silent privacy, in the lair of
the skull.62 Yet each communicant is well aware that the ceremony he performs is being
replicated simultaneously by thousands (or millions) of others of whose existence he is
confident, yet of whose identity he has not the slightest notion. Furthermore, this ceremony is
incessantly repeated at daily or half-daily intervals throughout the calendar. What more vivid
figure for the secular, historically clocked, imagined community can be envisioned?63 At the
same time, the newspaper reader, observing exact replicas of his own paper being consumed
by his subway, barbershop, or residential neighbours, is continually reassured that the
imagined world is visibly rooted in [36] everyday life. As with Noli Me Tangere, fiction
seeps quietly and continuously into reality, creating that remarkable confidence of
community in anonymity which is the hallmark of modern nations.
Before proceeding to a discussion of the specific origins of nationalism, it may be useful to
recapitulate the main propositions put forward thus far. Essentially, I have been arguing that
the very possibility of imagining the nation only arose historically when, and where, three
fundamental cultural conceptions, all of great antiquity, lost their axiomatic grip on men's
minds. The first of these was the idea that a particular script-language offered privileged
access to ontological truth, precisely because it was an inseparable part of that truth. It was
this idea that called into being the great transcontinental sodalities of Christendom, the
Islamic Ummah, and the rest. Second was the belief that society was naturally organized
around and under high centres -monarchs who were persons apart from other human beings
and who ruled by some form of cosmological (divine) dispensation. Human loyalties were
necessarily hierarchical and centripetal because the ruler, like the sacred script, was a node of
access to being and inherent in it. Third was a conception of temporality in which cosmology
and history were indistinguishable, the origins of the world and of men essentially identical.
Combined, these ideas rooted human lives firmly in the very nature of things, giving certain
meaning to the everyday fatalities of existence (above all death, loss, and servitude) and
offering, in various ways, redemption from them.
The slow, uneven decline of these interlinked certainties, first in Western Europe, later
elsewhere, under the impact of economic change, 'discoveries' (social and scientific), and the
development of increasingly rapid communications, drove a harsh wedge between cosmology
and history. No surprise then that the search was on, so to speak, for a new way of linking
fraternity, power and time meaningfully together. Nothing perhaps more precipitated this
search, nor made it more fruitful, than print-capitalism, which made it possible for rapidly
growing numbers of people to think about themselves, and to relate themselves to others, in
profoundly new ways.

to accept the ideas of Darwin. At first I interpreted this refusal as obscurantism. Subsequently I came to see it as
an honourable attempt to be consistent: the doctrine of evolution was simply not compatible with the teachings
of Islam. What are we to make of a scientific materialism which formally accepts the findings of physics about
matter, yet makes so little effort to link these findings with the class struggle, revolution, or whatever. Does not
the abyss between protons and the proletariat conceal an unacknowledged metaphysical conception of man? But

4. The late President Sukarno always spoke with complete sincerity of the 350 years of colonialism that his
'Indonesia' had endured, although the very concept 'Indonesia' is a twentieth-century invention, and most of
today's Indonesia was only conquered by the Dutch between 1850 and 1910. Preeminent among contemporary
Indonesia's national heroes is the early nineteenth-century Javanese Prince Diponegoro, although the Prince's
own memoirs show that he intended to 'conquer [not liberate!]J<3fd,' rather than expel 'the Dutch.'Indeed, he
clearly had no concept of 'the Dutch' as a collectivity. See Harry J. Benda and John A. Larkin, eds., The World
of Southeast Asia, p. 158; and AnnKumar, 'Diponegoro(1778?-1855),' Indonesia, 13 (April 1972), p. 103.

Hittites and Sumerians their Turkish forebears. Before laughing too hard, we should remaind ourselves of

21. Notice the displacement in rulers' nomenclature that corresponds to this transformation. Schoolchildren
remember monarchs by their first names (what was William the Conqueror's surname?), presidents by their last
(what was Ebert's Christian name?). In a world of citizens, all of whom are theoretically eligible for the
presidency, the limited pool of 'Christian* names makes them inadequate as specifying designators. In
monarchies, however, where rule is reserved for a single surname, it is necessarily 'Christian'names, with
numbers, or sobriquets, that supply the requisite distinctions.
22. We may here note in passing that Nairn is certainly correct in describing the 1707 Act of Union between
England and Scotland as a 'patrician bargain,' in the sense that the union's architects were aristocratic politicians.
(See his lucid discussion in The Break-up of Britain, pp. 136f). Still, it is difficult to imagine such a bargain
being struck between the aristocracies of two republics. The conception of a United Kingdom was surely the
crucial mediating element that made the deal possible.

24. Most notably in pre-modern Asia. But the same principle was at work in monogamous Christian Europe. In
1910, one Otto Forst put out his Ahnentafel Seiner Kaiserlichen und Kcniglichen Hoheit des durchlauchtigsten
Hern Erzherzogs Franz Ferdinand, listing 2,047 of the soon-to-be-assassinated Archduke's ancestors. They
included 1,486 Germans, 124 French, 196 Italians, 89 Spaniards, 52 Poles, 47 Danes, 20 Englishmen/women, as
well as four other nationalities. This 'curious document" is cited in ibid., p. 136, no. 1. I can not resist quoting

Ascyltus.
38. In this context it is rewarding to compare any historical novel with documents or narratives from the period fictionalized.

often ascending to the origin of man, which are so characteristic a feature of ancient chronicles, legends, and holy books.
40. Rizal wrote this novel in the colonial language (Spanish), which was then the lingua franca of the ethnically diverse Eurasian
and native elites. Alongside the novel appeared also for the first time a 'nationalist' press, not only in Spanish but in such 'ethnic'
languages as Tagalog and Ilocano. See Leopoldo Y. Yabes, 'The Modern Literature of the Philippines,' pp. 287-302, in Pierre-

43. The obverse side of the readers' anonymous obscurity was/is the author's immediate celebrity. As we shall see, this
obscurity/celebrity has everything to do with the spread of print-capitalism. As early as 1593 energetic Dominicans had published in
Manila the Doctrina Christiana. But for centuries thereafter print remained under tight ecclesiastical control. Liberalization only
began in the 1860s. See Bienvenido L. Lumbera, Tagalog Poetry 1570-1898, Tradition and Influences in its Development, pp. 35,

54. Reading a newspaper is like reading a novel whose author has abandoned any thought of a coherent plot.
55. Febvre and Martin, The Coming of the Book, p. 186. This amounted to no less than 35,000 editions produced in no fewer than
236 towns. As early as 1480, presses existed in more than 110 towns, of which 50 were in today's Italy, 30 in Germany, 9 in France,
8 each in Holland and Spain, 5 each in Belgium and Switzerland, 4 in England, 2 in Bohemia, and 1 in Poland. 'From that date it
may be said of Europe that the printed book was in universal use." (p. 182).

58. This is one point solidly made amidst the vagaries of Marshall McLuhan's Gutenberg Galaxy (p. 125). One might add that if the
book market was dwarfed by the markets in other commodities, its strategic role in the dissemination of ideas nonetheless made it of
central importance to the development of modern Europe.
59. The principle here is more important than the scale. Until the nineteenth century, editions were still relatively small. Even
Luther's Bible, an extraordinary best-seller, had only a 4,000-copy first edition. The unusually large first edition of Diderot's
Encyclopedic numbered no more than 4,250. The average eighteenth-century run was less than 2,000. Febvre and Martin, The
Coming of the Book, pp. 218-20. At the same time, the book was always distinguishable from other durables by its inherently
limited market. Anyone with money can buy Czech cars; only Czech-readers will buy Czech-language books. The importance of
this distinction will be considered below.
60. Furthermore, as early as the late fifteenth century the Venetian publisher Aldus had pioneered the portable 'pocket edition."
61. As the case of Semarang Hitatn shows, the two kinds of best-sellers used to be more closely linked than they are today. Dickens
too serialized his popular novels in popular newspapers.

63. Writing of the relationship between the material anarchy of middle-class society and an abstract political state-order, Nairn
observes that 'the representative mechanism converted real class inequality into the abstract egalitarianism of citizens, individual
egotisms into an impersonal collective will, what would otherwise be chaos into a new state legitimacy.' The Break-up of Britain, p.
24. No doubt. But the representative mechanism (elections?) is a rare and moveable feast. The generation of the impersonal will is, I
think, better sought in the diurnal regularities of the imagining life.
3. The Origins of National Consciousness
[37] If the development of print-as-commodity is the key to the generation of wholly new
ideas of simultaneity, still, we are simply at the point where communities of the type
'horizontal-secular, transverse-time' become possible. Why, within that type, did the nation
become so popular? The factors involved are obviously complex and various. But a strong
case can be made for the primacy of capitalism.
As already noted, at least 20,000,000 books had already been printed by 1500,t signalling the
onset of Benjamin's 'age of mechanical reproduction.' If manuscript knowledge was scarce
and arcane lore, print knowledge lived by reproducibility and dissemination.2 If, as Febvre
and Martin believe, possibly as many as 200,000,000 volumes had been manufactured by
1600, it is no wonder that Francis Bacon believed that print had changed 'the appearance and
state of the world.'3
One of the earlier forms of capitalist enterprise, book-publishing [38] felt all of capitalism's
restless search for markets. The early printers established branches all over Europe: 'in this
way a veritable "international" of publishing houses, which ignored national [sic] frontiers,
was created.'4 And since the years 1500-1550 were a period of exceptional European
prosperity, publishing shared in the general boom. 'More than at any other time' it was 'a great
industry under the control of wealthy capitalists.'5 Naturally, 'book-sellers were primarily
concerned to make a profit and to sell their products, and consequently they sought out first
and foremost those works which were of interest to the largest possible number of their contemporaries.'
6
The initial market was literate Europe, a wide but thin stratum of Latin-readers. Saturation of
this market took about a hundred and fifty years. The determinative fact about Latin-aside
from its sacrality - was that it was a language of bilinguals. Relatively few were born to speak
it and even fewer, one imagines, dreamed in it. In the sixteenth century the proportion of
bilinguals within the total population of Europe was quite small; very likely no larger than the
proportion in the world's population today, and - proletarian internationalism notwithstanding
- in the centuries to come. Then and now the bulk of mankind is monoglot. The logic of
capitalism thus meant that once the elite Latin market was saturated, the potentially huge
markets represented by the monoglot masses would beckon. To be sure, the Counter-
Reformation encouraged a temporary resurgence of Latin-publishing, but by the midseventeenth
century the movement was in decay, and fervently Catholic libraries replete.
Meantime, a Europe-wide shortage of money made printers think more and more of peddling
cheap editions in the vernaculars.7
[39] The revolutionary vernacularizing thrust of capitalism was given further impetus by
three extraneous factors, two of which contributed directly to the rise of national
consciousness. The first, and ultimately the least important, was a change in the character of
Latin itself. Thanks to the labours of the Humanists in reviving the broad literature of pre-
Christian antiquity and spreading it through the print-market, a new appreciation of the
sophisticated stylistic achievements of the ancients was apparent among the trans-European
intelligentsia. The Latin they now aspired to write became more and more Ciceronian, and,
by the same token, increasingly removed from ecclesiastical and everyday life. In this way it
acquired an esoteric quality quite different from that of Church Latin in mediaeval times. For
the older Latin was not arcane because of its subject matter or style, but simply because it
was written at all, i.e. because of its status as text. Now it became arcane because of what was
written, because of the language-in-itself.
Second was the impact of the Reformation, which, at the same time, owed much of its
success to print-capitalism. Before the age of print, Rome easily won every war against
heresy in Western Europe because it always had better internal lines of communication than
its challengers. But when in 1517 Martin Luther nailed his theses to the chapel-door in
Wittenberg, they were printed up in German translation, and 'within 15 days [had been] seen
in every part of the country.'8 In the two decades 1520-1540 three times as many books were
published in German as in the period 1500-1520, an astonishing transformation to which
Luther was absolutely central. His works represented no less than one third of all Germanlanguage
books sold between 1518 and 1525. Between 1522 and 1546, a total of 430 editions
(whole or partial) of his Biblical translations appeared. 'We have here for the first time a truly
mass readership and a popular literature within everybody's reach.'9 In effect, Luther became
the first best-selling author so known. Or, to put it another way, the first writer who could
'sell' his new books on the basis of his name.10
[40] Where Luther led, others quickly followed, opening the colossal religious propaganda
war that raged across Europe for the next century. In this titanic 'battle for men's minds',
Protestantism was always fundamentally on the offensive, precisely because it knew how to
make use of the expanding vernacular print-market being created by capitalism, while the
Counter-Reformation defended the citadel of Latin. The emblem for this is the Vatican's
Index Librorum Prohibitorum - to which there was no Protestant counterpart - a novel
catalogue made necessary by the sheer volume of printed subversion. Nothing gives a better
sense of this siege mentality than Francois I's panicked 1535 ban on the printing of any books
in his realm - on pain of death by hanging! The reason for both the ban and its unenforceability
was that by then his realm's eastern borders were ringed with Protestant states
and cities producing a massive stream of smugglable print. To take Calvin's Geneva alone:
between 1533 and 1540 only 42 editions were published there, but the numbers swelled to
527 between 1550 and 1564, by which latter date no less than 40 separate printing-presses
were working overtime.11
The coalition between Protestantism and print-capitalism, exploiting cheap popular editions,
quickly created large new reading publics - not least among merchants and women, who
typically knew little or no Latin-and simultaneously mobilized them for politico-religious
purposes. Inevitably, it was not merely the Church that was shaken to its core. The same
earthquake produced Europe's first important non-dynastic, non-city states in the Dutch
Republic and the Commonwealth of the Puritans. (Francois I's panic was as much political as
religious.)
Third was the slow, geographically uneven, spread of particular vernaculars as instruments of
administrative centralization by certain well-positioned would-be absolutist monarchs. Here it
is useful to remember that the universality of Latin in mediaeval Western Europe never
corresponded to a universal political system. The [41] contrast with Imperial China, where
the reach of the mandarinal bureaucracy and of painted characters largely coincided, is
instructive. In effect, the political fragmentation of Western Europe after the collapse of the
Western Empire meant that no sovereign could monopolize Latin and make it his-and-onlyhis
language-of-state, and thus Latin's religious authority never had a true political analogue.
The birth of administrative vernaculars predated both print and the religious upheaval of the
sixteenth century, and must therefore be regarded (at least initially) as an independent factor
in the erosion of the sacred imagined community. At the same time, nothing suggests that any
deep-seated ideological, let alone proto-national, impulses underlay this vernacularization
where it occurred. The case of 'England' - on the northwestern periphery of Latin Europe - is
here especially enlightening. Prior to the Norman Conquest, the language of the court, literary
and administrative, was Anglo-Saxon. For the next century and a half virtually all royal
documents were composed in Latin. Between about 1200 and 1350 this state-Latin was
superseded by Norman French. In the meantime, a slow fusion between this language of a
foreign ruling class and the Anglo-Saxon of the subject population produced Early English.
The fusion made it possible for the new language to take its turn, after 1362, as the language
of the courts-and for the opening of Parliament. Wycliffe's vernacular manuscript Bible
followed in 1382.12 It is essential to bear in mind that this sequence was a series of'state,'not
'national,' languages; and that the state concerned covered at various times not only today's
England and Wales, but also portions of Ireland, Scotland and France. Obviously, huge
elements of the subject populations knew little or nothing of Latin, Norman French, or Early
English.13 Not till almost a century after Early English's political enthronement was London's
power swept out of 'France'.
On the Seine, a similar movement took place, if at a slower pace. [42] As Bloch wrily puts it,
'French, that is to say a language which, since it was regarded as merely a corrupt form of
Latin, took several centuries to raise itself to literary dignity',14 only became the official
language of the courts of justice in 1539, when Francois I issued the Edict of Villers-
Cotterets.15 In other dynastic realms Latin survived much longer - under the Habsburgs well
into the nineteenth century. In still others, 'foreign' vernaculars took over: in the eighteenth
century the languages of the Romanov court were French and German.16
In every instance, the 'choice' of language appears as a gradual, unselfconscious, pragmatic,
not to say haphazard development. As such, it was utterly different form the selfconscious
language policies pursued by nineteenth-century dynasts confronted with the rise of hostile
popular linguistic-nationalisms. (See below, Chapter 6). One clear sign of the difference is
that the old administrative languages were just that: languages used by and for officialdoms
for their own inner convenience. There was no idea of systematically imposing the language
on the dynasts' various subject populations.17 Nonetheless, the elevation of these vernaculars
to the status of languages-of-power, where, in one sense, they were competitors with Latin
(French in Paris, [Early] English in London), made its own contribution to the decline of the
imagined community of Christendom.
At bottom, it is likely that the esotericization of Latin, the Reformation, and the haphazard
development of administrative vernaculars are significant, in the present context, primarily in
a negative sense-in their contributions to the dethronement of Latin. It is quite possible to
conceive of the emergence of the new imagined national communities without any one,
perhaps all, of them being present. What, in a positive sense, made the new communities
imaginable was a half-fortuitous, but explosive, interaction between [43] a system of
production and productive relations (capitalism), a technology of communications (print), and
the fatality of human linguistic diversity.18
The element of fatality is essential. For whatever superhuman feats capitalism was capable of,
it found in death and languages two tenacious adversaries.19 Particular languages can die or
be wiped out, but there was and is no possibility of humankind's general linguistic
unification. Yet this mutual incomprehensibility was historically of only slight importance
until capitalism and print created monoglot mass reading publics.
While it is essential to keep in mind an idea of fatality, in the sense of a general condition of
irremediable linguistic diversity, it would be a mistake to equate this fatality with that
common element in nationalist ideologies which stresses the primordial fatality of particular
languages and their association with particular territorial units. The essential thing is the
interplay between fatality, technology, and capitalism. In pre-print Europe, and, of course,
elsewhere in the world, the diversity of spoken languages, those languages that for their
speakers were (and are) the warp and woof of their lives, was immense; so immense, indeed,
that had print-capitalism sought to exploit each potential oral vernacular market, it would
have remained a capitalism of petty proportions. But these varied idiolects were capable of
being assembled, within definite limits, into print-languages far fewer in number. The very
arbitrariness of any system of signs for sounds facilitated the assembling process.20 (At the
same time, the more ideographic the signs, the vaster the potential [44] assembling zone. One
can detect a sort of descending hierarchy here from algebra through Chinese and English, to
the regular syllabaries of French or Indonesian.) Nothing served to 'assemble' related
vernaculars more than capitalism, which, within the limits imposed by grammars and
syntaxes, created mechanically reproduced print-languages capable of dissemination through
the market.21
These print-languages laid the bases for national consciousnesses in three distinct ways. First
and foremost, they created unified fields of exchange and communication below Latin and
above the spoken vernaculars. Speakers of the huge variety of Frenches, Englishes, or
Spanishes, who might find it difficult or even impossible to understand one another in
conversation, became capable of comprehending one another via print and paper. In the
process, they gradually became aware of the hundreds of thousands, even millions, of people
in their particular language-field, and at the same time that only those hundreds of thousands,
or millions, so belonged. These fellow-readers, to whom they were connected through print,
formed, in their secular, particular, visible invisibility, the embryo of the nationally imagined
community.
Second, print-capitalism gave a new fixity to language, which in the long run helped to build
that image of antiquity so central to the subjective idea of the nation. As Febvre and Martin
remind us, the printed book kept a permanent form, capable of virtually infinite reproduction,
temporally and spatially. It was no longer subject to the individualizing and 'unconsciously
modernizing' habits of monastic scribes. Thus, while twelfth-century French differed
markedly from that written by Villon in the fifteenth, the rate of change slowed decisively in
the sixteenth. 'By the 17th century languages in Europe had generally assumed their modern
forms.'22 To [45] put it another way, for three centuries now these stabilized print-languages
have been gathering a darkening varnish; the words of our seventeenth-century forebears are
accessible to us in a way that to Villon his twelfth-century ancestors were not.
Third, print-capitalism created languages-of-power of a kind different from the older
administrative vernaculars. Certain dialects inevitably were 'closer' to each print-language
and dominated their final forms. Their disadvantaged cousins, still assimilable to the
emerging print-language, lost caste, above all because they were unsuccessful (or only
relatively successful) in insisting on their own print-form. 'Northwestern German' became
Platt Deutsch, a largely spoken, thus sub-standard, German, because it was assimilable to
print-German in a way that Bohemian spoken-Czech was not. High German, the King's
English, and, later, Central Thai, were correspondingly elevated to a new politico-cultural
eminence. (Hence the struggles in late-twentieth-century Europe by certain 'sub-'nationalities
to change their subordinate status by breaking firmly into print-and radio.)
It remains only to emphasize that in their origins, the fixing of print-languages and the
differentiation of status between them were largely unselfconscious processes resulting from
the explosive interaction between capitalism, technology and human linguistic diversity. But
as with so much else in the history of nationalism, once 'there,' they could become formal
models to be imitated, and, where expedient, consciously exploited in a Machiavellian spirit.
Today, the Thai government actively discourages attempts by foreign missionaries to provide
its hill-tribe minorities with their own transcription-systems and to develop publications in
their own languages: the same government is largely indifferent to what these minorities
speak. The fate of the Turkic-speaking peoples in the zones incorporated into today's Turkey,
Iran, Iraq, and the USSR is especially exemplary. A family of spoken languages, once
everywhere assemblable, thus comprehensible, within an Arabic orthography, has lost that
unity as a result of conscious manipulations. To heighten Turkish-Turkey's national
consciousness at the expense of any wider Islamic identification, Atatürk imposed [46]
compulsory romanization.23 The Soviet authorities followed suit, first with an anti-Islamic,
anti-Persian compulsory romanization, then, in Stalin's 1930s, with a Russifying compulsory
Cyrillicization.24
We can summarize the conclusions to be drawn from the argument thus far by saying that the
convergence of capitalism and print technology on the fatal diversity of human language
created the possibility of a new form of imagined community, which in its basic morphology
set the stage for the modern nation. The potential stretch of these communities was inherently
limited, and, at the same time, bore none but the most fortuitous relationship to existing
political boundaries (which were, on the whole, the highwater marks of dynastic
expansionisms).
Yet it is obvious that while today almost all modern self-conceived nations-and also nationstates-
have 'national print-languages', many of them have these languages in common, and in
others only a tiny fraction of the population 'uses' the national language in conversation or on
paper. The nation-states of Spanish America or those of the 'Anglo-Saxon family' are
conspicuous examples of the first outcome; many ex-colonial states, particularly in Africa, of
the second. In other words, the concrete formation of contemporary nation-states is by no
means isomorphic with the determinate reach of particular print-languages. To account for
the discontinuity-in-connectedness between print-languages, national consciousness, and
nation-states, it is necessary to turn to the large cluster of new political entities that sprang up
in the Western hemisphere between 1776 and 1838, all of which self-consciously defined
themselves as nations, and, with the interesting exception of Brazil, as (non-dynastic)
republics. For not only were they historically the first such states to emerge on the world
stage, and therefore inevitably provided the first real models of what such states should 'look
like,' but their numbers and contemporary births offer fruitful ground for comparative
enquiry.

theomorphizing 'print' qua print as the genius of modern history. Febvre and Martin never forget that behind
print stand printers and publishing firms. It is worth remembering in this context that although printing was
invented first in China, possibly 500 years before its appearance in Europe, it had no major, let alone
revolutionary impact — precisely because of the absence of capitalism there.

4. Creole Pioneers
[47] The new American states of the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries are of
unusual interest because it seems almost impossible to explain them in terms of two factors
which, probably because they are readily derivable from the mid-century nationalisms of
Europe, have dominated much provincial European thinking about the rise of nationalism.
In the first place, whether we think of Brazil, the USA, or the former colonies of Spain,
language was not an element that differentiated them from their respective imperial
metropoles. All, including the USA, were Creole states, formed and led by people who shared
a common language and common descent with those against whom they fought.1 Indeed, it is
fair to say that language was never even an issue in these early struggles for national
liberation.
In the second place, there are serious reasons to doubt the applicability in much of the
Western hemisphere of Nairn's otherwise persuasive thesis that:
The arrival of nationalism in a distinctively modern sense was tied to the political baptism
of the lower classes... Although sometimes [48] hostile to democracy, nationalist
movements have been invariably populist in outlook and sought to induct lower classes
into political life. In its most typical version, this assumed the shape of a restless middleclass
and intellectual leadership trying to sit up and channel popular class energies into
support for the new states.2
At least in South and Central America, European-style 'middle classes' were still insignificant
at the end of the eighteenth century. Nor was there much in the way of an intelligentsia. For
'in those quiet colonial days little reading interrupted the stately and snobbish rhythm of
men's lives.'3 As we have seen, the first Spanish-American novel was published only in 1816,
well after the wars for independence had broken out. The evidence clearly suggests that
leadership was held by substantial landowners, allied with a somewhat smaller number of
merchants, and various types of professional (lawyers, military men, local and provincial
functionaries).4
Far from seeking to 'induct the lower classes into political life,' one key factor initially
spurring the drive for independence from Madrid, in such important cases as Venezuela,
Mexico and Peru, was the fear of'lower-class' political mobilizations: to wit, Indian or Negroslave
uprisings.5 (This fear only increased when Hegel's 'secretary of the World-Spirit'
conquered Spain in 1808, thereby depriving the Creoles of peninsular military backup in case
of emergency.) In Peru, memories of the greatjacquerie led by Tupac Amarii (1740-1781)
were still fresh.6 In 1791, Toussaint L'Ouverture led an insurrection of black slaves that
produced in 1804 the second independent republic in the Western hemisphere - and terrified
the great slave-owning [49] planters of Venezuela.7 When, in 1789, Madrid issued a new,
more humane, slave law specifying in detail the rights and duties of masters and slaves, 'the
Creoles rejected state intervention on the grounds that slaves were prone to vice and
independence [!], and were essential to the economy. In Venezuela - indeed all over the
Spanish Caribbean -planters resisted the law and procured its suspension in 1794.'8 The
Liberator Bolivar himself once opined that a Negro revolt was 'a thousand times worse than a
Spanish invasion. '9 Nor should we forget that many leaders of the independence movement
in the Thirteen Colonies were slave-owning agrarian magnates. Thomas Jefferson himself
was among the Virginian planters who in the 1770s were enraged by the loyalist governor's
proclamation freeing those slaves who broke with their seditious masters.10 It is instructive
that one reason why Madrid made a successful come-back in Venezuela from 1814-1816 and
held remote Quito until 1820 was that she won the support of slaves in the former, and of
Indians in the latter, in the struggle against insurgent Creoles.11 Moreover, the long duration
of the continental struggle against Spain, by then a second-rate European power and one itself
recently conquered, suggests a certain 'social thinness' to these Latin American independence
movements.
Yet they were national independence movements. Bolivar came to change his mind about
slaves,12 and his fellow-liberator San Martin decreed in 1821 that 'in the future the aborigines
shall not be called [50]
Indians or natives; they are children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as
Peruvians.'13 (We might add: in spite of the fact that as yet print-capitalism had not reached
these illiterates.)
Here then is the riddle: why was it precisely creole communities that developed so early
conceptions of their nation-ness - well before most of Europe'? Why did such colonial
provinces, usually containing large, oppressed, non-Spanish-speaking populations, produce
Creoles who consciously redefined these populations as fellow-nationals? And Spain,14 to
whom they were, in so many ways, attached, as an enemy alien? Why did the Spanish-
American Empire, which had existed calmly for almost three centuries, quite suddenly
fragment into eighteen separate states?
The two factors most commonly adduced in explanation are the tightening of Madrid's
control and the spread of the liberalizing ideas of the Enlightenment in the latter half of the
eighteenth century. It is undoubtedly true that the policies pursued by the capable 'enlightened
despot' Carlos III (r. 1759-1788) increasingly frustrated, angered, and alarmed the upper
creole classes. In what has sometimes sardonically been called the second conquest of the
Americas, Madrid imposed new taxes, made their collection more efficient, enforced metropolitan
commercial monopolies, restricted intra-hemispheric trade to its own advantage,
centralized administrative hierarchies, and promoted a heavy immigration of peninsulares.15
Mexico, for example, in the early eighteenth century provided the Crown with an annual
revenue of about 3,000,000 pesos. By the century's end, however, the sum had almost
quintupled to 14,000,000, of which only 4,000,000 were used to defray the costs of local
administration.16 Parallel to this, the level of peninsular migration by the decade [51] 1780-
1790 was five times as high as it had been between 1710-1730.17
There is also no doubt that improving trans-Atlantic communications, and the fact that the
various Americas shared languages and cultures with their respective metropoles, meant a
relatively rapid and easy transmission of the new economic and political doctrines being
produced in Western Europe. The success of the Thirteen Colonies' revolt at the end of the
1770s, and the onset of the French Revolution at the end of the 1780s, did not fail to exert a
powerful influence. Nothing confirms this 'cultural revolution' more than the pervasive
republicanism of the newly independent communities.18 Nowhere was any serious attempt
made to recreate the dynastic principle in the Americas, except in Brazil; even there, it would
probably not have been possible without the immigration in 1808 of the Portuguese dynast
himself, in flight from Napole'on. (He stayed there for 13 years, and, on returning home, had
his son crowned locally as Pedro I of Brazil.)19
Yet the aggresiveness of Madrid and the spirit of liberalism, while central to any
understanding of the impulse of resistance in the Spanish Americas, do not in themselves
explain why entities like Chile, Venezuela, and Mexico turned out to be emotionally plausible
[52] and politically viable,20 nor why San Martin should decree that certain aborigines be
identified by the neological 'Peruvians.' Nor, •ultimately, do they account for the real
sacrifices made. For while it is certain that the upper Creole classes, conceived as historical
social formations, did nicely out of independence over the long haul, many actual members
of those classes living between 1808 and 1828 were financially ruined. (To take only one
example: during Madrid's counter-offensive of 1814-16 'more than two-thirds of Venezuela's
landowning families suffered heavy confiscations."21) And just as many willingly gave up
their lives for the cause. This willingness to sacrifice on the part of comfortable classes is
food for thought.
What then? The beginnings of an answer lie in the striking fact that 'each of the new South
American republics had been an administrative unit from the sixteenth to the eighteenth
century.'22 In this respect they foreshadowed the new states of Africa and parts of Asia in the
mid twentieth century, and form a sharp contrast to the new European states of the late
nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The original shaping of the American administrative
units was to some extent arbitrary and fortuitous, marking the spatial limits of particular
military conquests. But, over time, they developed a firmer reality under the influence of
geographic, political and economic factors. The very vastnessofthe Spanish American empire,
the enormous variety of its soils and climates, and, above all, the immense difficulty of
communications in a pre-industrial age, tended to give these units a self-contained character.
(In the colonial era the sea journey from Buenos Aires to Acapulco took four months, and the
return trip even longer; the overland trek from Buenos Aires to Santiago normally lasted two
months, and that to Cartagena nine.23) In addition, Madrid's commercial policies had the
effect of turning administrative units into separate economic zones. 'All competition [53] with
the mother country was forbidden the Americans, and even the individual parts of the
continent could not trade with each other. American goods en route from one side of America
to the other had to travel circuitously through Spanish ports, and Spanish navigation had a
monopoly on trade with the colonies.'24 These experiences help to explain why 'one of the
basic principles of the American revolution' was that of 'uti possidetis by which each nation
was to preserve the territorial status quo of 1810, the year when the movement for
independence had been inaugurated.'25 Their influence also doubtless contributed to the
break-up of Bolivar's short-lived Gran Colombia and of the United Provinces of the Rio de la
Plata into their older constituents (which today are known as Venezuela-Colombia-Ecuador
and Argentina-Uruguay-Paraguay-Bolivia). Nonetheless, in themselves, market-zones,
'natural'-geographic or politico-administrative, do not create attachments. Who will willingly
die for Comecon or the EEC?
To see how administrative units could, over time, come to be conceived as fatherlands, not
merely in the Americas but in other parts of the world, one has to look at the ways in which
administrative organizations create meaning. The anthropologist Victor Turner has written
illuminatingly about the journey', between times, statuses and places, as a meaning-creating
experience.26 All such journeys require interpretation (for example, the journey from birth to
death has given rise to various religious conceptions.) For our purposes here, the modal
journey is the pilgrimage. It is not simply that in the minds of Christians, Muslims or Hindus
the cities of Rome, Mecca, or Benares were the centres of sacred geographies, but that their
centrality was experienced and [54] 'realized' (in the stagecraft sense) by the constant flow of
pilgrims moving towards them from remote and otherwise unrelated localities. Indeed, in
some sense the outer limits of the old religious communities of the imagination were
determined by which pilgrimages people made.27 As noted earlier, the strange physical
juxtaposition of Malays, Persians, Indians, Berbers and Turks in Mecca is something
incomprehensible without an idea of their community in some form. The Berber encountering
the Malay before the Kaaba must, as it were, ask himself: 'Why is this man doing what I am
doing, uttering the same words that I am uttering, even though we can not talk to one
another?' There is only one answer, once one has learnt it: 'Because we... are Muslims.' There
was, to be sure, always a double aspect to the choreography of the great religious
pilgrimages: a vast horde of illiterate vernacular-speakers provided the dense, physical reality
of the ceremonial passage; while a small segment of literate bilingual adepts drawn from each
vernacular community performed the unifying rites, interpreting to their respective followings
the meaning of their collective motion.28 In a pre-print age, the reality of the imagined
religious community depended profoundly on countless, ceaseless travels. Nothing more
impresses one about Western Christendom in its heyday than the uncoerced flow of faithful
seekers from all over Europe, through the celebrated 'regional centres' of monastic learning,
to Rome. These great Latin-speaking institutions drew together what today we would perhaps
regard as Irishmen, Danes, Portuguese, Germans, and so forth, in communities whose sacred
meaning was every day deciphered from their members' otherwise inexplicable juxtaposition
in the refectory.
Though the religious pilgrimages are probably the most touching [55] and grandiose journeys
of the imagination, they had, and have, more modest and limited secular counterparts.29 For
our present purposes, the most important were the differing passages created by the rise of
absolutizing monarchies, and, eventually, Europe-centred world-imperial states. The inner
thrust of absolutism was to create a unified apparatus of power, controlled directly by, and
loyal to, the ruler over against a decentralized, particularistic feudal nobility. Unification
meant internal interchangeability of men and documents. Human interchangeability was
fostered by the recruitment - naturally to varying extents-of homines novi, who, just for that
reason, had no independent power of their own, and so could serve as emanations of their
masters' wills.30 Absolutist functionaries thus undertook journeys which were basically
different from those of feudal nobles.31 The difference can be represented schematically as
follows: In the modal feudal journey, the heir of Noble A, on his father's death, moves up one
step to take that father's place. This ascension requires a round-trip, to the centre for
investiture, and then back home to the ancestral demesne. For the new functionary, however,
things are more complex. Talent, not death, charts his course. He sees before him a summit
rather than a centre. He travels up its corniches in a series of looping arcs which, he hopes,
will become smaller and tighter as he nears the top. Sent out to township A at rank V, he may
return to the capital at rank W; proceed to province B at rank X; continue to vice-royalty C at
rank Y; and end his pilgrimage in the capital at rank Z. On this journey there is no assured
resting-place; every pause is provisional. The last thing the functionary wants is to return
home; for he has no home with any intrinsic value. And this: on his upward-spiralling road he
encounters as eager fellow-pilgrims his functionary colleagues, from places and families he
has scarcely [56] heard of and surely hopes never to have to see. But in experiencing them as
travelling-companions, a consciousness of connectedness ('Why are we... here. .. together'?')
emerges, above all when all share a single language-of-state. Then, if official A from
province B administers province C, while official D from province C administers province B
- a situation that absolutism begins to make likely-that experience of interchangeability
requires its own explanation: the ideology of absolutism, which the new men themselves, as
much as the sovereign, elaborate.
Documentary interchangeability, which reinforced human inter-changeability, was fostered
by the development of a standardized language-of-state. As the stately succession of Anglo-
Saxon, Latin, Norman, and Early English in London from the eleventh through the fourteenth
centuries demonstrates, any written language could, in principle, serve this function -
provided it was given monopoly rights. (One could, however, argue that where vernaculars,
rather than Latin, happened to hold the monopoly, a further centralizing function was
achieved, by restricting the drift of one sovereign's officials to his rivals' machines: so to
speak ensuring that Madrid's pilgrim-functionaries were not interchangeable with those of
Paris.)
In principle, the extra-European expansion of the great kingdoms of early modern Europe
should have simply extended the above model in the development of grand, transcontinental
bureaucracies. But, in fact, this did not happen. The instrumental rationality of the absolutist
apparatus - above all its tendency to recruit and promote on the basis of talent rather than of
birth-operated only fitfully beyond the eastern shores of the Atlantic.32
The pattern is plain in the Americas. For example, of the 170 viceroys in Spanish America
prior to 1813, only 4 were Creoles. These figures are all the more startling if we note that in
1800 less than 5% of the 3,200,000 creole 'whites' in the Western Empire (imposed on about
13,700,000 indigenes) were Spain-born Spaniards. On the eve [57] of the revolution in
Mexico, there was only one Creole bishop, although Creoles in the viceroyalty outnumbered
peninsulares by 70 to I.33 And, needless to say, it was nearly unheard-of for a Creole to rise to
a position of official importance in Spain.34 Moreover, the pilgrimages of Creole functionaries
were not merely vertically barred. If peninsular officials could travel the road from Zaragoza
to Cartagena, Madrid, Lima, and again Madrid, the 'Mexican' or 'Chilean' Creole typically
served only in the territories of colonial Mexico or Chile: his lateral movement was as
cramped as his vertical ascent. In this way, the apex of his looping climb, the highest
administrative centre to which he could be assigned, was the capital of the imperial
administrative unit in which he found himself.35 Yet on this cramped pilgrimage he found
travelling-companions, who came to sense that their fellowship was based not only on that
pilgrimage's particular stretch, but on the shared fatality of trans-Atlantic birth. Even if he
was born within one week of his father's [58] migration, the accident of birth in the Americas
consigned him to subordination - even though in terms of language, religion, ancestry, or
manners he was largely indistinguishable from the Spain-born Spaniard. There was nothing
to be done about it: he was irremediably a Creole. Yet how irrational his exclusion must have
seemed! Nonetheless, hidden inside the irrationality was this logic: born in the Americas, he
could not be a true Spaniard; ergo, born in Spain, the peninsular could not be a true
American.36
What made the exclusion appear rational in the metropole? Doubtless the confluence of a
time-honoured Machiavellism with the growth of conceptions of biological and ecological
contamination that accompanied the planetary spread of Europeans and European power from
the sixteenth century onwards. From the sovereign's angle of vision, the American Creoles,
with their ever-growing numbers and increasing local rootedness with each succeeding
generation, presented a historically unique political problem. For the first time the metropoles
had to deal with-for that era-vast numbers of 'fellow-Europeans' (over three million in the
Spanish Americas by 1800) far outside Europe. If the indigenes were conquerable by arms
and disease, and controllable by the mysteries of Christianity and a completely alien culture
(as well as, for those days, an advanced political organization), the same was not true of the
Creoles, who had virtually the same relationship to arms, disease, Christianity and European
culture as the metropolitans. In other words, in principle, they had readily at hand the
political, cultural and military means for successfully asserting themselves. They constituted
simultaneously a colonial community and an upper class. They were to be economically
subjected and exploited, but they were also essential to the stability of the empire. One can
see, in this light, a certain parallelism between the position of the Creole [59] magnates and
of feudal barons, crucial to the sovereign's power, but also a menace to it. Thus the
peninsulares dispatched as viceroys and bishops served the same functions as did the
homines novi of the proto-absolutist bureaucracies.37 Even if the viceroy was a grandee in his
Andalusian home, here, 5,000 miles away, juxtaposed to the Creoles, he was effectively a
homo novus fully dependent on his metropolitan master. The tense balance between
peninsular official and Creole magnate was in this way an expression of the old policy of
divide et impera in a new setting.
In addition, the growth of Creole communities, mainly in the Americas, but also in parts of
Asia and Africa, led inevitably to the appearance of Eurasians, Eurafricans, as well as
Euramericans, not as occasional curiosities but as visible social groups. Their emergence
permitted a style of thinking to flourish which foreshadows modern racism. Portugal, earliest
of Europe's planetary conquerors, provides an apt illustration of this point. In the last decade
of the fifteenth century Dom Manuel I could still 'solve' his 'Jewish question' by mass,
forcible conversion - possibly the last European ruler to find this solution both satisfactory
and 'natural'.38 Less than a century later, however, one finds Alexandre Valignano, the great
reorganizer of the Jesuit mission in Asia between 1574 and 1606, vehemently opposing the
admission of Indians and Eurindians to the priesthood in these terms:39
All these dusky races are very stupid and vicious, and of the basest spirits ... As for the mestizos
and castifos, we should receive either very few or none at all; especially with regard to the
mestizos, since the more native blood they have, the more they resemble the Indians and the less
they are esteemed by the Portuguese.
(Yet Valignano actively encouraged the admission of Japanese, Koreans, Chinese, and
'Indochinese' to the priestly function – perhaps [60] because in those zones mestizos had yet
to appear in any numbers?) Similarly, the Portuguese Franciscans in Goa violently opposed
admission of Creoles to the order, alleging that 'even if born of pure white parents [they] have
been suckled by Indian ayahs in their infancy and thus had their blood contaminated for
life.'40 Boxer shows that 'racial' bars and exclusions increased markedly during the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries by comparison with earlier practice. To this malignant
tendency the revival of large-scale slavery (for the first time in Europe since antiquity), which
was pioneered by Portugal after 1510, made its own massive contribution. Already in the
1550s, 10% of Lisbon's population were slaves; by 1800 there were close to a million slaves
among the 2,500,000 or so inhabitants of Portugal's Brazil.41
Indirectly, the Enlightenment also influenced the crystallization of a fatal distinction between
metropolitans and Creoles. In the course of his twenty-two years in power (1755-1777), the
enlightened autocrat Pombal not only expelled the Jesuits from Portuguese domains, but
made it a criminal offence to call 'coloured' subjects by offensive names, such as 'nigger' or
'mestico' [sic]. But he justified this decree by citing ancient Roman conceptions of imperial
citizenship, not the doctrines of the philosophes ,42 More typically, the writings of Rousseau
and Herder, which argued that climate and 'ecology' had a constitutive impact on culture and
character, exerted wide influence.43 It was only too easy from there to make the convenient,
vulgar deduction that Creoles, born in a savage hemisphere, were by nature different from,
and inferior to, the metropolitans - and thus unfit for higher office.44
[61] Our attention thus far has been focussed on the worlds of functionaries in the Americas -
strategically important, but still small worlds. Moreover, they were worlds which, with their
conflicts between peninsulares and Creoles, predated the appearance of American national
consciousnesses at the end of the eighteenth century. Cramped viceregal pilgrimages had no
decisive consequences until their territorial stretch could be imagined as nations, in other
words until the arrival of print-capitalism.
Print itself spread early to New Spain, but for two centuries it remained under the tight
control of crown and church. Till the end of the seventeenth century, presses existed only in
Mexico City and Lima, and their output was almost exclusively ecclesiastical. In Protestant
North America printing scarcely existed at all in that century. In the course of the eighteenth,
however, a virtual revolution took place. Between 1691 and 1820, no less than 2,120
'newspapers' were published, of which 461 lasted more than ten years.45
The figure of Benjamin Franklin is indelibly associated with Creole nationalism in the
northern Americas. But the importance of his trade may be less apparent. Once again, Febvre
and Martin are enlightening. They remind us that 'printing did not really develop in [North]
America during the eighteenth century until printers discovered a new source of income - the
newspaper.'46 Printers starting new presses always included a newspaper in their productions,
to which they were usually the main, even the sole, contributor. Thus the printer-journalist
was initially an essentially North American phenomenon. Since the main problem facing the
printer-journalist was reaching readers, there developed an alliance with the post-master so
intimate that often each became the other. Hence, the printer's office emerged as the key to
North American communications and community intellectual life. In Spanish America, albeit
more slowly and intermittently, similar processes [62] produced, in the second half of the
eighteenth century, the first local presses.47
What were the characteristics of the first American newspapers, North or South? They began
essentially as appendages of the market. Early gazettes contained - aside from news about the
metropole -commercial news (when ships would arrive and depart, what prices were current
for what commodities in what ports), as well as colonial political appointments, marriages of
the wealthy, and so forth. In other words, what brought together, on the same page, this
marriage with that ship, this price with that bishop, was the very structure of the colonial
administration and market-system itself. In this way, the newspaper of Caracas quite
naturally, and even apolitically, created an imagined community among a specific assemblage
of fellow-readers, to whom these ships, brides, bishops and prices belonged. In time, of
course, it was only to be expected that political elements would enter in.
One fertile trait of such newspapers was always their provinciality. A colonial Creole might
read a Madrid newspaper if he got the chance (but it would say nothing about his world), but
many a peninsular official, living down the same street, would, if he could help it, not read
the Caracas production. An asymmetry infinitely replicable in other colonial situations.
Another such trait was plurality. The Spanish-American journals that developed towards the
end of the eighteenth century were written in full awareness of provincials in worlds parallel
to their own. The newspaper-readers of Mexico City, Buenos Aires, and Bogota, even if they
did not read each other's newspapers, were nonetheless quite conscious of their existence.
Hence a well-known doubleness in early Spanish-American nationalism, its alternating grand
stretch and particularistic localism. The fact that early Mexican nationalists wrote of
themselves as nosotros los Americanos and of their country as nuestra America, has been
interpreted as revealing the vanity of the local Creoles who, because Mexico was far the most
valuable of Spain's American possessions, saw themselves as the centre of the New World.48
But, in fact, people [63] all over Spanish America thought of themselves as 'Americans,' since
this term denoted precisely the shared fatality of extra-Spanish birth.49
At the same time, we have seen that the very conception of the newspaper implies the
refraction of even 'world events' into a specific imagined world of vernacular readers; and
also how important to that imagined community is an idea of steady, solid simultaneity
through time. Such a simultaneity the immense stretch of the Spanish American Empire, and
the isolation of its component parts, made difficult to imagine.50 Mexican Creoles might learn
months later of developments in Buenos Aires, but it would be through Mexican newspapers,
not those of the Rio de la Plata; and the events would appear as 'similar to' rather than 'part of
events in Mexico.
In this sense, the 'failure' of the Spanish-American experience to generate a permanent
Spanish-America-wide nationalism reflects both the general level of development of
capitalism and technology in the late eighteenth century and the 'local' backwardness of
Spanish capitalism and technology in relation to the administrative stretch of the empire. (The
world-historical era in which each nationalism is born probably has a significant impact on its
scope. Is Indian nationalism not inseparable from colonial administrative-market unification,
after the Mutiny, by the most formidable and advanced of the imperial powers?)
The Protestant, English-speaking Creoles to the north were much more favourably situated
for realizing the idea of 'America' and indeed eventually succeeded in appropriating the
everyday title of 'Americans'. The original Thirteen Colonies comprised an area [64] smaller
than Venezuela, and one third the size of Argentina.51 Bunched geographically together, their
market-centres in Boston, New York, and Philadelphia were readily accessible to one
another, and their populations were relatively tightly linked by print as well as commerce.
The 'United States' could gradually multiply in numbers over the next 183 years, as old and
new populations moved westwards out of the old east coast core. Yet even in the case of the
USA there are elements of comparative 'failure' or shrinkage - non-absorption of Englishspeaking
Canada, Texas's decade of independent sovereignty (1835-46). Had a sizeable
English-speaking community existed in California in the eighteenth century, is it not likely
that an independent state would have arisen there to play Argentina to the Thirteen Colonies'
Peru? Even in the USA, the affective bonds of nationalism were elastic enough, combined
with the rapid expansion of the western frontier and the contradictions generated between the
economies of North and South, to precipitate a war of secession almost a century after the
Declaration of Independence; and this war today sharply reminds us of those that tore
Venezuela and Ecuador off from Gran Colombia, and Uruguay and Paraguay from the United
Provinces of the Rio de la Plata.52
By way of provisional conclusion, it may be appropriate to re-emphasize the limited and
specific thrust of the argument so far. It is intended less to explain the socio-economic bases
of anti-metropolitan resistance in the Western hemisphere between say, 1760 and 1830, than
why the resistance was conceived in plural, 'national' forms-rather than in others. The
economic interests at stake are well-known and obviously of fundamental importance.
[65] Liberalism and the Enlightenment clearly had a powerful impact, above all in providing
an arsenal of ideological criticisms of imperial and anciens regimes. What I am proposing is
that neither economic interest, Liberalism, nor Enlightenment could, or did, create in
themselves the kind, or shape, of imagined community to be defended from these regimes'
depredations; to put it another way, none provided the framework of a new consciousness -
the scarcely-seen periphery of its vision - as opposed to centre-field objects of its admiration
or disgust.53 In accomplishing this specific task, pilgrim Creole functionaries and provincial
Creole printmen played the decisive historic role.

12. Not without some twists and turns. He freed his own slaves shortly after Venezuela's declaration of
independence in 1810. When he fled to Haiti in 1816, he obtained military assistance from President Alexandre
Petion in return for a promise to end slavery in all territories liberated. The promise was redeemed in Caracas in
1818-but it should be remembered that Madrid's successes in Venezuela between 1814 and 1816 were in part
due to her emancipation of loyal slaves. When Bolivar became president of Gran Colombia (Venezuela, New
Granada and Ecuador) in 1821, he asked for and obtained from Congress a law freeing the sons of slaves. He
'had not asked Congress to wipe out slavery because he did not want to incur the resentment of the big
landowners.' Masur, Bolivar, pp. 125, 206-207, 329, and 388.

Murilo de Carvalho, 'Political Elites and State Building: The Case of Nineteenth-Century Brazil', Comparative
Studies in Society and History, 24:3 (1982), pp. 378-99. Two of the more important factors were: (1)
Educational differences. While 'twenty-three universities were scattered in what eventually would become
thirteen different countries' in the Spanish Americas, 'Portugal refused systematically to allow the organization
of any institution of higher learning in her colonies, not considering as such the theological seminaries.' Higher
education was only to be had in Coimbra University, and thither, in the motherland, went the Creole elite's
children, the great majority studying in the faculty of law. (2) Different career possibilities for Creoles. De
Carvalho notes 'the much greater exclusion of American-born Spaniards from the higher posts in the Spanish
side [sic].' See also Stuart B. Schwartz, 'The Formation of a Colonial Identity in Brazil,' chapter 2 in Nicholas
Canny and Anthony Pagden, eds, Colonial Identity in the Atlantic World, 1500-1800, who notes in passing (p.
38) that 'no printing press operated in Brazil during the first three centuries of the colonial era.'
20. Much the same could be said of London's stance vis-a-vis the Thirteen Colonies, and of the ideology of the
1776 Revolution.

28. There are obvious analogies here with the respective roles of bilingual intelligentsias and largely illiterate
workers and peasants in the genesis of certain nationalist movements - prior to the coming of radio. Invented
only in 1895, radio made it possible to bypass print and summon into being an aural representation of the
imagined community where the printed page scarcely penetrated. Its role in the Vietnamese and Indonesian
revolutions, and generally in mid-twentieth-century nationalisms, has been much underestimated and
understudied.
29. The 'secular pilgrimage' should not be taken merely as a fanciful trope. Conrad was being ironical, but also
precise, when he described as 'pilgrims' the spectral agents of Leopold II in the heart of darkness.
30. Especially where: (a) monogamy was religiously and legally enforced; (b) primogeniture was the rule; (c)
non-dynastic titles were both inheritable and conceptually and legally distinct from office-rank: i.e. where
provincial aristocracies had significant independent power - England, as opposed to Siam.
31. See Bloch, Feudal Society, II, pp. 422ff.
32. Obviously this rationality should not be exaggerated. The case of the United Kingdom, where Catholics
were barred from office until 1829, is not unique. Can one doubt that this long exclusion played an important
role in fostering Irish nationalism?
33. Lynch, The Spanish-American Revolutions, pp. 18-19,298. Of the roughly 15,000 peninsulares, half were
soldiers.
34. In the first decade of the nineteenth century there seem to have been about 400 South Americans resident in
Spain at any one time. These included the 'Argentinian' San Martin, who was taken to Spain as a small boy, and
spent the next 27 years there, entering the Royal Academy for noble youth, and playing a distinguished part in
the armed struggle against Napoleon before returning to his homeland on hearing of its declaration of
independence; and Bolivar, who for a time boarded in Madrid with Manuel Mello, 'American' lover of Queen
Marie Louise. Masur describes him as belonging (c. 1805) to 'a group of young South Americans' who, like him,
'were rich, idle and in disfavour with the Court. The hatred and sense of inferiority felt by many Creoles for the
mother country was in them developing into revolutionary impulses.' Bolivar, pp. 41-47, and 469-70 (San
Martin).
35. Over time, military pilgrimages became as important as civilian. 'Spain had neither the money nor the
manpower to maintain large garrisons of regular troops in America, and she relied chiefly on colonial militias,
which from the mid-eighteenth century were expanded and reorganized.' (Ibid., p. 10). These militias were quite
local, not interchangeable parts of a continental security apparatus. They played an increasingly critical role
from the 1760s on, as British incursions multiplied. Bolivar's father had been a prominent militia commander,
defending Venezuelan ports against the intruders. Bolivar himself served in his father's old unit as a teenager.
(Masur, Bolivar, pp. 30 and 38). In this respect he was typical of many of the first-generation nationalist leaders
of Argentina, Venezuela, and Chile. See Robert L. Gilmore, Caudillism and Militarism in Venezuela, 1810-
1910, chapter 6['The Militia'] and 7 ['The Military'].
36. Notice the transformations that independence brought the Americans: first-generation immigrants now
became 'lowest' rather than 'highest', i.e. the ones most contaminated by a fatal place of birth. Similar inversions
occur in response to racism. 'Black blood'- taint of the tar-brush-came, under imperialism, to be seen as
hopelessly contaminating for any 'white.' Today, in the United States at least, the 'mulatto' has entered the
museum. The tiniest trace of 'black blood' makes one beautifully Black. Contrast Fermin's optimistic program
for miscegenation, and his absence of concern for the colour of the expected progeny.
37. Given Madrid's deep concern that the management of the colonies be in trustworthy hands, 'it was axiomatic
that the high posts be filled exclusively with native-born Spaniards'. Masur, Bolivar, p. 10.

topic under review is the rise of Creole nationalism. This should not be understood as minimizing the parallel
growth of Creole racism towards mestizos, Negroes, and Indians; nor the willingness of an unthreatened
metropole to protect (up to a certain point) these unfortunates.

52. Paraguay forms a case of exceptional interest. Thanks to the relatively benevolent dictatorship established
there by the Jesuits early in the seventeenth century, the indigenes were better treated than elsewhere in Spanish
America, and Guarani achieved the status of print-language. The Crown's expulsion of the Jesuits from Spanish
America in 1767 brought the territory into the Rio de la Plata, but very late in the day, and for little more than a
generation. See Seton-Watson, Nations and States, pp. 200-201.

'nation'makesitsdebutonly in the Constitution of 1789. Kemilainen, Nationalism, p. 105.
5. Old Languages, New Models
[67] The close of the era of successful national liberation movements in the Americas
coincided rather closely with the onset of the age of nationalism in Europe. If we consider the
character of these newer nationalisms which, between 1820 and 1920, changed the face of the
Old World, two striking features mark them off from their ancestors. First, in almost all of
them 'national print-languages'were of central ideological and political importance, whereas
Spanish and English were never issues in the revolutionary Americas. Second, all were able
to work from visible models provided by their distant, and after the convulsions of the French
Revolution, not so distant, predecessors. The 'nation' thus became something capable of being
consciously aspired to from early on, rather than a slowly sharpening frame of vision. Indeed,
as we shall see, the 'nation' proved an invention on which it was impossible to secure a patent.
It became available for pirating by widely different, and sometimes unexpected, hands. In this
chapter, therefore, the analytical focus will be on print-language and piracy.
In blithe disregard of some obvious extra-European facts, the great Johann Gottfried von
Herder (1744-1803) had declared, towards the end of the eighteenth century, that: 'Denn
jedes Volk ist Volk; es hat [68] seine National Bildung wie seine Sprache.'1 This splendidly
eng-European conception of nation-ness as linked to a private-property language had wide
influence in nineteenth-century Europe and, more narrowly, on subsequent theorizing about
the nature of nationalism. What were the origins of this dream? Most probably, they lay in the
profound shrinkage of the European world in time and space that began already in the
fourteenth century, and was caused initially by the Humanists' excavations and later,
paradoxically enough, by Europe's planetary expansion.
As Auerbach so well expresses it:2
With the first dawn of humanism, there began to be a sense that the events of classical history and
legend and also those of the Bible were not separated from the present simply by an extent of time
but also by completely different conditions of life. Humanism with its program of renewal of
antique forms of life and expression creates a historical perspective in depth such as no previous
epoch known to us possessed: the humanists see antiquity in historical depth, and, against that
background, the dark epochs of the intervening Middle Ages... . [This made impossible] reestablishing
the autarchic life natural to antique culture or the historical naivete' of the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries.
The growth of what might be called 'comparative history'led in time to the hitherto unheardof
conception of a 'modernity' explicitly juxtaposed to 'antiquity,' and by no means
necessarily to the latter's advantage. The issue was fiercely joined in the 'Battle of Ancients
and Moderns' which dominated French intellectual life in the last quarter of the seventeenth
century.3 To quote Auerbach again, 'Under Louis XIV the French had the courage to consider
their own [69] culture a valid model on a par with that of the ancients, and they imposed this
view upon the rest of Europe.'4
In the course of the sixteenth century, Europe's 'discovery' of grandiose civilizations hitherto
only dimly rumoured-in China, Japan, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent-or
completely unknown - Aztec Mexico and Incan Peru - suggested an irremediable human
pluralism. Most of these civilizations had developed quite separate from the known history of
Europe, Christendom, Antiquity, indeed man: their genealogies lay outside of and were
unassimilable to Eden. (Only homogeneous, empty time would offer them accommodation.)
The impact of the 'discoveries' can be gauged by the peculiar geographies of the imaginary
polities of the age. More's Utopia, which appeared in 1516, purported to be the account of a
sailor, encountered by the author in Antwerp, who had participated in Amerigo Vespucci's
1497-1498 expedition to the Americas. Francis Bacon's New Atlantis (1626) was perhaps new
above all because it was situated in the Pacific Ocean. Swift's magnificent Island of the
Houyhnhnms (1726) came with a bogus map of its South Atlantic location. (The meaning of
these settings may be clearer if one considers how unimaginable it would be to place Plato's
Republic on any map, sham or real.) All these tongue-in-cheek Utopias, 'modelled' on real
discoveries, are depicted, not as lost Edens, but as contemporary societies. One could argue
that they had to be, since they were composed as criticisms of contemporary societies, and the
discoveries had ended the necessity for seeking models in a vanished antiquity.5 In the wake
of the Utopians came the luminaries of the Enlightenment, Vico, Montesquieu, Voltaire, and
Rousseau, who increasingly exploited a 'real' non-Europe for a barrage of subversive writings
directed against current European social and political institutions. In effect, it became
possible to think of Europe as only [70] one among many civilizations, and not necessarily
the Chosen or the best.6
In due course, discovery and conquest also caused a revolution in European ideas about
language. From the earliest days, Portuguese, Dutch, and Spanish seamen, missionaries,
merchants and soldiers had, for practical reasons - navigation, conversion, commerce and war
- gathered word-lists of non-European languages to be assembled in simple lexicons. But it
was only in the later eighteenth century that the scientific comparative study of languages
really got under way. Out of the English conquest of Bengal came William Jones's pioneering
investigations of Sanskrit (1786), which led to a growing realization that Indie civilization
was far older than that of Greece or Judaea. Out of Napoleon's Egyptian expedition came
Jean Champollion's decipherment of hieroglyphics (1835), which plural-ized that extra-
European antiquity.7 Advances in Semitics undermined the idea that Hebrew was either
uniquely ancient or of divine provenance. Once again, genealogies were being conceived
which could only be accommodated by homogeneous, empty time. 'Language became less of
a continuity between an outside power and the human speaker than an internal field created
and accomplished by language users among themselves.'8 Out of these discoveries came
philology, with its studies of comparative grammar, classification of languages into families,
and reconstructions by scientific reasoning of 'proto-languages' out of oblivion. As
Hobsbawm rightly observes, here was 'the first science which regarded evolution as its very
core.'9
From this point on the old sacred languages - Latin, Greek, and Hebrew - were forced to
mingle on equal ontological footing with a motley plebeian crowd of vernacular rivals, in a
movement which complemented their earlier demotion in the market-place by printcapitalism.
If all languages now shared a common (intra-)mundane [71] status, then all were
in principle equally worthy of study and admiration. But by who? Logically, since now none
belonged to God, by their new owners: each language's native speakers-and readers.
As Seton-Watson most usefully shows, the nineteenth century was, in Europe and its
immediate peripheries, a golden age of vernacularizing lexicographers, grammarians,
philologists, and litterateurs.10 The energetic activities of these professional intellectuals were
central to the shaping of nineteenth-century European nationalisms in complete contrast to
the situation in the Americas between 1770 and 1830. Monolingual dictionaries were vast
compendia of each language's print-treasury, portable (if sometimes barely so) from shop to
school, office to residence. Bilingual dictionaries made visible an approaching egalitarianism
among languages - whatever the political realities outside, within the covers of the Czech-
German/German-Czech dictionary the paired languages had a common status. The visionary
drudges who devoted years to their compilation were of necessity drawn to or nurtured by the
great libraries of Europe, above all those of the universities. And much of their immediate
clientele was no less inevitably university and pre-university students. Hobsbawm's dictum
that 'the progress of schools and universities measures that of nationalism, just as schools and
especially universities became its most conscious champions,' is certainly correct for
nineteenth-century Europe, if not for other times and places.11
[72] One can thus trace this lexicographic revolution as one might the ascending roar in an
arsenal alight, as each small explosion ignites others, till the final blaze turns night into day.
By the middle of the eighteenth century, the prodigious labours of German, French and
English scholars had not only made available in handy printed form virtually the entire extant
corpus of the Greek classics, along with the necessary philological and lexicographic
adjuncts, but in dozens of books were recreating a glittering, and firmly pagan, ancient
Hellenic civilization. In the last quarter of the century, this 'past' became increasingly
accessible to a small number of young Greek-speaking Christian intellectuals, most of whom
had studied or travelled outside the confines of the Ottoman Empire.12 Exalted by the
philhellenism at the centres of Western European civilization, they undertook the
'debarbarizing' of the modern Greeks, i.e., their transformation into beings worthy of Pericles
and Socrates.13 Emblematic of this change in consciousness are the following words of one of
these young men, Adamantios Koraes (who later became an ardent lexicographer!), in an
address to a French audience in Paris in 1803:14
For the first time the nation surveys the hideous spectacle of its ignorance and trembles in
measuring with the eye the distance separating it from its ancestors' glory. This painful discovery,
however, does not precipitate the Greeks into despair: We are the descendants of Greeks, they
implicitly told themselves, we must either try to become again worthy of this name, or we must not
bear it.
Similarly in the late eighteenth century, grammars, dictionaries and histories of Rumanian
appeared, accompanied by a drive, successful at first in the Habsburg realms, later in the
Ottoman, for the replacement of Cyrillic by the Roman alphabet (marking [73] Rumanian
sharply off from its Slavic-Orthodox neighbours).15 Between 1789 and 1794, the Russian
Academy, modelled on the Academic Franchise, produced a six-volume Russian dictionary,
followed by an official grammar in 1802. Both represented a triumph of the vernacular over
Church Slavonic. Although right into the eighteenth century Czech was the language only of
the peasantry in Bohemia (the nobility and rising middle classes spoke German), the Catholic
priest Josef Dobrovsky (1753-1829) produced in 1792 his Geschichte der bohmischen
Sprache und ahem Literatur, the first systematic history of the Czech language and literature.
In 1835-39 appeared Josef Jungmann's pioneering five-volume Czech-German dictionary.16
Of the birth of Hungarian nationalism Ignotus writes that it is an event 'recent enough to be
dated: 1772, the year of publication of some unreadable works by the versatile Hungarian
author Gyorgy Bessenyei, then a resident in Vienna and serving in Maria Theresa's
bodyguard.... Bessenyei's magna opera were meant to prove that the Hungarian language was
suitable for the very highest literary genre.>17 Further stimulus was provided by the extensive
publications of Ferenc Kazinczy (1759-1831), 'the father of Hungarian literature,' and by the
removal, in 1784, of what became the University of Budapest to that city from the small
provincial town of Trnava. Its first political expression was the Latin-speaking Magyar
nobility's hostile reaction in the 1780s to Emperor Joseph II's decision to replace Latin by
German as the prime language of imperial administration.18
In the period 1800-1850, as the result of pioneering work by native [74] scholars, three
distinct literary languages were formed in the northern Balkans: Slovene, Serbo-Croat, and
Bulgarian. If, in the 1830s, 'Bulgarians' had been widely thought to be of the same nation as
the Serbs and Croats, and had in fact shared in the Illyrian Movement, a separate Bulgarian
national state was to come into existence by 1878. In the eighteenth century, Ukrainian (Little
Russian) was contemptuously tolerated as a language of yokels. But in 1798 Ivan
Kotlarevsky wrote his Aeneid, an enormously popular satirical poem on Ukrainian life. In
1804, the University of Kharkov was founded and rapidly became the centre for a boom in
Ukrainian literature. In 1819 appeared the first Ukrainian grammar-only 17 years after the
official Russian one. And in the 1830s followed the works of Taras Shevchenko, of whom
Seton-Watson observes that 'the formation of an accepted Ukrainian literary language owes
more to him than to any other individual. The use of this language was the decisive stage in
the formation of an Ukrainian national consciousness.>19 Shortly thereafter, in 1846, the first
Ukrainian nationalist organization was founded in Kiev-by a historian!
In the eighteenth century the language-of-state in today's Finland was Swedish. After the
territory's union with Czardom in 1809, the official language became Russian. But an
'awakening' interest in Finnish and the Finnish past, first expressed through texts written in
Latin and Swedish in the later eighteenth century, by the 1820s was increasingly manifested
in the vernacular.20 The leaders of the burgeoning Finnish nationalist movement were 'persons
whose profession largely consisted of the handling of language: writers, teachers, pastors, and
lawyers. The study of folklore and the rediscovery and piecing together of popular epic
poetry went together with the publication of grammars and dictionaries, and led to the
appearance of periodicals which served to standardize Finnish literary [i.e. print-] language,
on behalf of which stronger political [75] demands could be advanced. '21 In the case of
Norway, which had long shared a written language with the Danes, though with a completely
different pronunciation, nationalism emerged with Ivar Aasen's new Norwegian grammar
(1848) and dictionary (1850), texts which responded to and stimulated demands for a
specifically Norwegian print-language.
Elsewhere, in the latter portion of the nineteenth century, we find Afrikaner nationalism
pioneered by Boer pastors and litterateurs, who in the 1870s were successful in making the
local Dutch patois into a literary language and naming it something no longer European.
Maronites and Copts, many of them products of Beirut's American College (founded in 1866)
and the Jesuit College of St. Joseph (founded in 1875) were major contributors to the revival
of classical Arabic and the spread of Arab nationalism.22 And the seeds of Turkish
nationalism are easily detectable in the appearance of a lively vernacular press in Istanbul in
the 1870s.23
Nor should we forget that the same epoch saw the vernacularization of another form of
printed page: the score. After Dobrovsky came Smetana, Dvorak, and Janacek; after Aasen,
Grieg; after Kazinczy, Bela Bartok; and so on well into our century.
At the same time, it is self-evident that all these lexicographers, philologists, grammarians,
folklorists, publicists, and composers did not carry on their revolutionary activities in a
vacuum. They were, after all, producers for the print-market, and they were linked, via that
silent bazaar, to consuming publics. Who were these consumers? In the most general sense:
the families of the reading classes-not merely the 'working father,' but the servant-girded wife
and the school-age children. If we note that as late as 1840, even in Britain and France, the
most advanced states in Europe, almost half the population was still illiterate (and in
backward Russia almost 98 per [76] cent), 'reading classes' meant people of some power.
More concretely, they were, in addition to the old ruling classes of nobilities and landed
gentries, courtiers and ecclesiastics, rising middle strata of plebeian lower officials,
professionals, and commercial and industrial bourgeoisies.
Mid-nineteenth-century Europe witnessed a rapid increase in state expenditures and the size
of state bureaucracies (civil and military), despite the absence of any major local wars.
'Between 1830 and 1850 public expenditure per capita increased by 25 per cent in Spain, by
40 per cent in France, by 44 per cent in Russia, by 50 per cent in Belgium, by 70 per cent in
Austria, by 75 per cent in the USA, and by over 90 per cent in The Netherlands.'24
Bureaucratic expansion, which also meant bureaucratic specialization, opened the gates of
official preferment to much greater numbers and of far more varied social origins than
hitherto. Take even the decrepit, sinecure-filled, nobility-ridden Austro-Hungarian state
machinery: the percentage of men of middle class origins in the top echelons of its civil half
rose from 0 in 1804, through 27 in 1829, 35 in 1859, to 55 in 1878. In the armed services, the
same trend appeared, though characteristically at a slower, later pace: the middle class
component of the officer corps rose from 10 per cent to 75 per cent between 1859 and 1918.25
If the expansion of bureaucratic middle classes was a relatively even phenomenon, occurring
at comparable rates in both advanced and backward states of Europe, the rise of commercial
and industrial bourgeoisies was of course highly uneven - massive and rapid in some places,
slow and stunted in others. But no matter where, this 'rise' has to be understood in its
relationship to vernacular print-capitalism.
The pre-bourgeois ruling classes generated their cohesions in some sense outside language, or
at least outside print-language. If the ruler of Siam took a Malay noblewoman as a concubine,
or if the King of England married a Spanish princess-did they ever talk seriously together?
Solidarities were the products of kinship, clientship, and [77] personal loyalties. 'French'
nobles could assist 'English' kings against 'French' monarchs, not on the basis of shared
language or culture, but, Machiavellian calculations aside, of shared kinsmen and friendships.
The relatively small size of traditional aristocracies, their fixed political bases, and the
personalization of political relations implied by sexual intercourse and inheritance, meant that
their cohesions as classes were as much concrete as imagined. An illiterate nobility could still
act as a nobility. But the bourgeoisie? Here was a class which, figuratively speaking, came
into being as a class only in so many replications. Factory-owner in Lille was connected to
factory-owner in Lyon only by reverberation. They had no necessary reason to know of one
another's existence; they did not typically marry each other's daughters or inherit each other's
property. But they did come to visualize in a general way the existence of thousands and
thousands like themselves through print-language. For an illiterate bourgeoisie is scarcely
imaginable. Thus in world-historical terms bourgeoisies were the first classes to achieve
solidarities on an essentially imagined basis. But in a nineteenth-century Europe in which
Latin had been defeated by vernacular print-capitalism for something like two centuries, these
solidarities had an outermost stretch limited by vernacular legibilities. To put it another way,
one can sleep with anyone, but one can only read some people's words.
Nobilities, landed gentries, professionals, functionaries, and men of the market - these then
were the potential consumers of the philological revolution. But such a clientele was almost
nowhere fully realized, and the combinations of actual consumers varied considerably from
zone to zone. To see why, one has to return to the basic contrast drawn earlier between
Europe and the Americas. In the Americas there was an almost perfect isomorphism between
the stretch of the various empires and that of their vernaculars. In Europe, however, such
coincidences were rare, and intra-European dynastic empires were basically polyvernacular.
In other words, power and print-language mapped different realms.
The general growth in literacy, commerce, industry, communications and state machineries
that marked the nineteenth century created powerful new impulses for vernacular linguistic
unification [78] within each dynastic realm. Latin hung on as a language-of-state in Austro-
Hungary as late as the early 1840s, but it disappeared almost immediately thereafter.
Language-of-state it might be, but it could not, in the nineteenth century, be the language of
business, of the sciences, of the press, or of literature, especially in a world in which these
languages continuously interpenetrated one another.
Meantime, vernacular languages-of-state assumed ever greater power and status in a process
which, at least at the start, was largely unplanned. Thus English elbowed Gaelic out of most
of Ireland, French pushed Breton to the wall, and Castilian reduced Catalan to marginality. In
those realms, such as Britain and France, where, for quite extraneous reasons, there happened
to be, by mid-century, a relatively high coincidence of language-of-state and language of the
population,26 the general interpenetration alluded to above did not have dramatic political
effects. (These cases are closest to those of the Americas.) In many other realms, of which
Austro-Hungary is probably the polar example, the consequences were inevitably explosive.
In its huge, ramshackle, polyglot, but increasingly literate, domain the replacement of Latin
by any vernacular, in the mid nineteenth century, promised enormous advantages to those of
its subjects who already used that print-language, and appeared correspondingly menacing to
those who did not. I emphasize the word any, since, as we shall be discussing in greater detail
below, German's nineteenth century elevation by the Habsburg court, German as some might
think it, had nothing whatever to do with German nationalism. (Under these circumstances,
one would expect a self-conscious nationalism to arise last in each dynastic realm among the
native-readers of the official vernacular. And such expectations are borne out by the historical
record.)
In terms of our lexicographers' clienteles, it is therefore not surprising to find very different
bodies of customers according to different political conditions. In Hungary, for example,
where [79] virtually no Magyar bourgeoisie existed, but one out of eight claimed some
aristocratic status, the parapets of print-Hungarian were defended against the German tide by
segments of the petty nobility and an impoverished landed gentry.27 Much the same could be
said of Polish-readers. More typical, however, was a coalition of lesser gentries, academics,
professionals, and businessmen, in which the first often provided leaders of 'standing,' the
second and third myths, poetry, newspapers, and ideological formulations, and the last money
and marketing facilities. The amiable Koraes offers us a fine vignette of the early clientele for
Greek nationalism, in which intellectuals and entrepreneurs predominated:28
In those towns which were less poor, which had some well-to-do inhabitants and a few schools,
and therefore a few individuals who could at least read and understand the ancient writers, the
revolution began earlier and could make more rapid and more comforting progress. In some of
these towns, schools are already being enlarged, and the study of foreign languages and even of
those sciences which are taught in Europe [sic] is being introduced into them. The wealthy sponsor
the printing of books translated from Italian, French, German, and English; they send to Europe at
their expense young men eager to learn; they give their children a better education, not excepting
girls....
Reading coalitions, with compositions that lay variously on the spectrum between Hungarian
and Greek, developed similarly throughout Central and Eastern Europe, and into the Near
East as the century proceeded.29 How far the urban and rural masses shared in the new
vernacularly imagined communities naturally also varied a [80] great deal. Much depended
on the relationship between these masses and the missionaries of nationalism. At one
extreme, perhaps, one might point to Ireland, where a Catholic priesthood drawn from the
peasantry and close to it played a vital mediating role. Another extreme is suggested by
Hobsbawm's ironic comment that: 'The Galician peasants in 1846 opposed the Polish
revolutionaries even though these actually proclaimed the abolition of serfdom, preferring to
massacre gentlemen and trust to the Emperor's officials.'30 But everywhere, in fact, as literacy
increased, it became easier to arouse popular support, with the masses discovering a new
glory in the print elevation of languages they had humbly spoken all along.
Up to a point, then, Nairn's arresting formulation -'The new middle-class intelligentsia of
nationalism had to invite the masses into history; and the invitation-card had to be written in a
language they understood'31 - is correct. But it will be hard to see why the invitation came to
seem so attractive, and why such different alliances were able to issue it (Nairn's middle-class
intelligentsia was by no means the only host), unless we turn finally to piracy.
Hobsbawm observes that 'The French Revolution was not made or led by a formed party or
movement in the modern sense, nor by men attempting to carry out a systematic programme.
It hardly even threw up "leaders" of the kind to which twentieth century revolutions have
accustomed us, until the post-revolutionary figure of Napoleon.'32 But once it had occurred, it
entered the accumulating memory of print. The overwhelming and bewildering concatenation
of events experienced by its makers and its victims became a 'thing'- and with its own name:
The French Revolution. Like a vast shapeless rock worn to a rounded boulder by countless
drops of water, the experience was shaped by millions of printed words into a 'concept' on the
printed page, and, in due course, into a model. Why 'it' broke out, what 'it' aimed for, why 'it'
succeeded or failed, became subjects for endless polemics on the part of friends and foes:
[81] but of its 'it-ness', as it were, no one ever after had much doubt.33
In much the same way, the independence movements in the Americas became, as soon as
they were printed about, 'concepts,' 'models', and indeed 'blueprints.' In 'reality', 'Bolivar's fear
of Negro insurrections and San Martin's summoning of his indigenes to Peruvianness jostled
one another chaotically. But printed words washed away the former almost at once, so that, if
recalled at all, it appeared an inconsequential anomaly. Out of the American welter came
these imagined realities: nation-states, republican institutions, common citizenships, popular
sovereignty, national flags and anthems, etc., and the liquidation of their conceptual
opposites: dynastic empires, monarchical institutions, absolutisms, subjecthoods, inherited
nobilities, serfdoms, ghettoes, and so forth. (Nothing more stunning, in this context, than the
general 'elision'of massive slavery from the 'modal' USA of the nineteenth century, and of the
shared language of the 'modal' Southern republics.) Furthermore, the validity and
generalizability of the blueprint were undoubtedly confirmed by the plurality of the
independent states.
In effect, by the second decade of the nineteenth century, if not earlier, a 'model' of 'the'
independent national state was available for pirating.34 (The first groups to do so were the
marginalized vernacular-based coalitions of the educated on which this chapter has been
focused.) But precisely because it was by then a known model, it imposed certain 'standards'
from which too-marked deviations were impermissible. Even backward and reactionary
Hungarian and Polish gentries were hard put to it not to make a show of 'inviting in' (if only
to the pantry) their oppressed compatriots. If you like, the logic of San Martin's
Peruvianization was at work. If ‘Hungarians’deserved a [82] national state, then that meant
Hungarians, all of them;35 it meant a state in which the ultimate locus of sovereignty had to be
the collectivity of Hungarian-speakers and readers; and, in due course, the liquidation of
serfdom, the promotion of popular education, the expansion of the suffrage, and so on. Thus
the 'populist' character of the early European nationalisms, even when led, demagogically, by
the most backward social groups, was deeper than in the Americas: serfdom had to go, legal
slavery was unimaginable - not least because the conceptual model was set in ineradicable
place.

half of the nineteenth century, the number of adolescents in schools was still minuscule by modern standards: a
mere 19,000 lycee students in France in 1842; 20,000 high school pupils among the 68,000,000 population of
Imperial Russia in 1850; a likely total of 48,000 university students in all Europe in 1848. Yet in the revolutions
of that year, this tiny, but strategic, group played a pivotal role. (pp. 166-67).

one third of the serfs were Magyar-speakers. In the early nineteenth century, the high Magyar aristocracy spoke
French or German; the middle and lower nobility 'conversed in a dog-Latin strewn with Magyar, but also with
Slovak, Serb, and Romanian expressions as well as vernacular German. ..." Ignotus, Hungary, pp. 45-46, and 81.
6. Official Nationalism and Imperialism
[83] In the course of the nineteenth century, and especially in its latter half, the philologicallexicographic
revolution and the rise of intra-European nationalist movements, themselves
the products, not only of capitalism, but of the elephantiasis of the dynastic states, created
increasing cultural, and therefore political, difficulties for many dynasts. For, as we have
seen, the fundamental legitimacy of most of these dynasties had nothing to do with
nationalness. Romanovs ruled over Tatars and Letts, Germans and Armenians, Russians and
Finns. Habsburgs were perched high over Magyars and Croats, Slovaks and Italians,
Ukrainians and Austro-Germans. Hanoverians presided over Bengalis and Quebecois, as well
as Scots and Irish, English and Welsh.1 On the continent, furthermore, members of the same
dynastic families often ruled in different, sometimes rivalrous, states. What nationality should
be assigned to Bourbons ruling in France and [84] Spain, Hohenzollerns in Prussia and
Rumania, Wittelsbachs in Bavaria and Greece?
We have also seen that for essentially administrative purposes these dynasties had, at
different speeds, settled on certain print-vernaculars as languages-of-state - with the 'choice'
of language essentially a matter of unselfconscious inheritance or convenience.
The lexicographic revolution in Europe, however, created, and gradually spread, the
conviction that languages (in Europe at least) were, so to speak, the personal property of quite
specific groups - their daily speakers and readers - and moreover that these groups, imagined
as communities, were entitled to their autonomous place in a fraternity of equals. The
philological incendiaries thus presented the dynasts with a disagreeable dilemma which did
not fail to sharpen over time. Nowhere is this dilemma clearer than in the case of Austro-
Hungary. When the enlightened absolutist Joseph II decided early in the 1780s to switch the
language of state from Latin to German, 'he did not fight, for instance, against the Magyar
language, but he fought against the Latin.... He thought that, on the basis of the mediaeval
Latin administration of the nobility, no effective work in the interest of the masses could have
been carried on. The necessity of a unifying language connecting all parts of his empire
seemed to him a peremptory claim. Under this necessity he could not choose any other
language than German, the only one which had a vast culture and literature under its sway
and which had a considerable minority in all his provinces.'2 Indeed, 'the Habsburgs were not
a consciously and consequentially Germanizing power... . There were Habsburgs who did not
even speak German. Even those Habsburg emperors who sometimes fostered a policy of
Germaniza-tion were not led in their efforts by any nationalistic point of view, but their
measures were dictated by the intent of unification and universalism of their empire.'3 Their
essential aim was Hausmacht. After the middle of the nineteenth century, however, German
[85] increasingly acquired a double status: 'universal-imperial' and 'particular-national'. The
more the dynasty pressed German in its first capacity, the more it appeared to be siding with
its German-speaking subjects, and the more it aroused antipathy among the rest. Yet if it did
not so press, indeed made concessions to other languages, above all Hungarian, not only was
unification set back, but its German-speaking subjects allowed themselves to feel affronted.
Thus it threatened to be hated simultaneously as champion of the Germans and traitor to
them. (In much the same way, the Ottomans came to be hated by Turkish-speakers as
apostates and by non-Turkish-speakers as Turkifiers.)
Insofar as all dynasts by mid-century were using some vernacular as language-of-state,4 and
also because of the rapidly rising prestige all over Europe of the national idea, there was a
discernible tendency among the Euro-Mediterranean monarchies to sidle towards a beckoning
national identification. Romanovs discovered they were Great Russians, Hanoverians that
they were English, Hohenzollerns that they were Germans-and with rather more difficulty
their cousins turned Romanian, Greek, and so forth. On the one hand, these new
identifications shored up legitimacies which, in an age of capitalism, scepticism, and science,
could less and less safely rest on putative sacrality and sheer antiquity. On the other hand,
they posed new dangers. If Kaiser Wilhelm II cast himself as 'No. 1 German,'he implicitly
conceded that he was one among many of the same kind as himself, that he had a
representative function, and therefore could, in principle, be a traitor to his fellow-Germans
(something inconceivable in the dynasty's heyday. Traitor to whom or to what?). In the wake
of the disaster that overtook Germany in 1918, he was taken at his implied word. Acting in
the name of the German nation, civilian politicians (publicly) and the General Staff (with its
usual courage, secretly) sent him packing from the Fatherland to an obscure Dutch suburb. So
too Mohammad-Reza Pahlavi, having cast himself, not as [86] Shah, but as Shah of Iran,
came to be branded traitor. That he himself accepted, not the verdict, but, as it were, the
jurisdiction of the national court, is shown by a small comedy at the moment of his departure
into exile. Before climbing the ramp of hisjet, he kissed the earth for the photographers and
announced that he was taking a small quantity of sacred Iranian soil with him. This take is
lifted from a film about Garibaldi, not the Sun King.5
The 'naturalizations' of Europe's dynasties - maneuvers that required in many cases some
diverting acrobatics-eventually led to what Seton-Watson bitingly calls 'official
nationalisms,'6 of which Czarist Russification is only the best-known example. These 'official
nationalisms' can best be understood as a means for combining naturalization with retention
of dynastic power, in particular over the huge polyglot domains accumulated since the
Middle Ages, or, to put it another way, for stretching the short, tight, skin of the nation over
the gigantic body of the empire. 'Russification' of the heterogeneous population of the Czar's
subjects thus represented a violent, conscious welding of two opposing political orders, one
ancient, one quite new. (While there is a certain analogy with, say, the Hispanization of the
Americas and the Philippines, one central difference remains. The cultural conquistadors of
late-nineteenth-century Czardom were proceeding from a selfconscious Machia-vellism,
while their sixteenth-century Spanish ancestors acted out of an unselfconscious everyday
pragmatism. Nor was it for them really 'Hispanization'-rather it was simply conversion of
heathens and savages.)
The key to situating 'official nationalism'-willed merger of nation and dynastic empire - is to
remember that it developed after, and in reaction to, the popular national movements
proliferating in Europe since the 1820s. If these nationalisms were modelled on [87]
American and French histories, so now they became modular in turn.7 It was only that a
certain inventive legerdemain was required to permit the empire to appear attractive in
national drag.
To gain some perspective on this whole process of reactionary, secondary modelling, we may
profitably consider some parallel, yet usefully contrasting cases.
How uneasy Romanov autocracy initially felt at 'taking to the streets' is excellently shown by
Seton-Watson.8 As noted earlier, the language of the court of St. Petersburg in the eighteenth
century was French, while that of much of the provincial nobility was German. In the
aftermath of Napoleon's invasion, Count Sergei Uvarov, in an official report of 1832,
proposed that the realm should be based on the three principles of Autocracy, Orthodoxy, and
Nationality (natsional-nost). If the first two were old, the third was quite novel-and somewhat
premature in an age when half the 'nation' were still serfs, and more than half spoke a mothertongue
other than Russian. Uvarov's report won him the post of Minister of Education, but
little more. For another half-century Czarism resisted Uvarovian enticements. It was not until
the reign of Alexander III (1881-94) that Russification became official dynastic policy: long
after Ukrainian, Finnish, Lett and other nationalisms had appeared within the Empire.
Ironically enough, the first Russifying measures were taken against precisely those
'nationalities' which had been most Kaisertreu - such as the Baltic Germans. In 1887, in the
Baltic provinces, Russian was made compulsory as the language of instruction in all state
schools above the lowest primary classes, a measure later extended to private schools as well.
In 1893, the University of Dorpat, one of the most distinguished colleges in the imperial
domains, was closed down because it used German in the lecture-rooms. (Recall that hitherto
German had been a provincial language-of-state, not the voice of a popular nationalist
movement). [88] And so on. Seton-Watson even goes so far as to venture that the Revolution
of 1905 was 'as much a revolution of non-Russians against Russification as it was a
revolution of workers, peasants, and radical intellectuals against autocracy. The two revolts
were of course connected: the social revolution was in fact most bitter in non-Russian
regions, with Polish workers, Latvian peasants, and Georgian peasants as protagonists.'9
At the same time, it would be a big mistake to suppose that since Russification was a
dynastic policy, it did not achieve one of its main purposes - marshalling a growing 'Great
Russian' nationalism behind the throne. And not simply on the basis of sentiment. Enormous
opportunities were after all available for Russian functionaries and entrepreneurs in the vast
bureaucracy and expanding market that the empire provided.
No less interesting than Alexander III, Russifying Czar of All the Russias, is his
contemporary Victoria von Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Queen of England and, late in life, Empress
of India. Actually her title is more interesting than her person, for it represents
emblematically the thickened metal of a weld between nation and empire.10 Her reign too
marks the onset of a London-style 'official nationalism' which has strong affinities with the
Russification being pursued in St. Petersburg. A good way to appreciate this affinity is by
longitudinal comparison.
In The Break-up of Britain, Tom Nairn raises the problem of why there was no Scottish
nationalist movement in the late eighteenth century, in spite of a rising Scots bourgeoisie and
a very distinguished Scots intelligentsia.11 Hobsbawm has peremptorily dismissed Nairn's
thoughtful discussion with the remark: 'It is pure anachronism to expect [the Scots] to have
demanded an independent state at this time.'12 Yet if we recall that Benjamin Franklin, who
co-signed the American Declaration of Independence, was born five years before [89] David
Hume, we may be inclined to think this judgement itself a shade anachronistic.13 It seems to
me that the difficulties - and their resolution - lie elsewhere.
On the other hand, there is Nairn's good nationalist tendency to treat his 'Scotland' as an
unproblematic, primordial given. Bloch reminds us of the chequered ancestry of this 'entity',
observing that the ravages of the Danes and William the Conqueror destroyed forever the
cultural hegemony of Northern, Anglo-Saxon Northum-bria, symbolized by such luminaries
as Alcuin and Bede:14
A part of the northern zone was detached for ever from England proper. Cut off from other
populations of Anglo-Saxon speech by the settlement of the Vikings in Yorkshire, the lowlands
round about the Northumbrian citadel of Edinburgh fell under the domination of the Celtic chiefs
of the hills. Thus the bilingual kingdom of Scotland was by a sort of backhanded stroke a creation
of the Scandinavian invasions.
And Seton-Watson, for his part, writes that the Scottish language:15
developed from the flowing together of Saxon and French, though with less of the latter and with
rather more from Celtic and Scandinavian sources than in the south. This language was spoken not
only in the east of Scotland but also in northern England. Scots, or 'northern English,' was spoken
at the Scottish court and by the social elite (who might or might not also speak Gaelic), as well as
by the Lowland popualtion as a whole. It was the language of the poets Robert Henryson and
William Dunbar. It might have developed as a distinct literary language into modern times had not
the union of the crowns in 1603 brought the predominance of southern English through its
extension to the court, administration and upper class of Scotland.
[90] The key point here is that already in the early seventeenth century large parts of what
would one day be imagined as Scotland were English-speaking and had immediate access to
print-English, provided a minimal degree of literacy existed. Then in the early eighteenth
century the English-speaking Lowlands collaborated with London in largely exterminating
the Gaeltacht. In neither 'northward thrust' was a selfconscious Anglicizing policy pursued- in
both cases Anglicization was essentially a byproduct. But combined, they had effectively
eliminated, 'before' the age of nationalism, any possibility of a European-style vernacularspecific
nationalist movement. Why not one in the American style? Part of the answer is
given by Nairn in passing, when he speaks of a 'massive intellectual migration' southwards
from the mid eighteenth century onwards.16 But there was more than an intellectual migration.
Scottish politicians came south to legislate, and Scottish businessmen had open access to
London's markets. In effect, in complete contrast to the Thirteen Colonies (and to a lesser
extent Ireland), there were no barricades on all these pilgrims' paths towards the centre.
(Compare the clear highway before Latin- and German-reading Hungarians to Vienna in the
eighteenth century.) English had yet to become an 'English' language.
The same point can be made from a different angle. It is true that in the seventeenth century
London resumed an acquisition of overseas territories arrested since the disastrous ending to
the Hundred Years War. But the 'spirit' of these conquests was still fundamentally that of a
prenational age. Nothing more stunningly confirms this than the fact that 'India' only became
'British' twenty years after Victoria's accession to the throne. In other words, until after the
1857 Mutiny, 'India' was ruled by a commercial enterprise-not by a state, and certainly not by
a nation-state.
But change was on the way. When the East India Company's charter came up for renewal in
1813, Parliament mandated the allocation of 100,000 rupees a year for the promotion of
native education, both 'oriental' and 'Western.' In 1823, a Committee of Public Instruction
was set up in Bengal; and in 1834, Thomas [91] Babington Macaulay became president of
this committee. Declaring that 'a single shelf of a good European library is worth the whole
native literature of India and Arabia,'17 he produced the following year his notorious 'Minute
on Education.' Luckier than Uvarov, his recommendations went into immediate effect. A
thoroughly English educational system was to be introduced which, in Macaulay's own
ineffable words, would create 'a class of persons, Indian in blood and colour, but English in
taste, in opinion, in morals and in intellect. '18 In 1836, he wrote that:19
No Hindu who has received an English education ever remains sincerely attached to his religion. It
is my firm belief [so they always were] that if our plans of education are followed up, there will
not be a single idolater among the respectable classes in Bengal thirty years hence.
There is here, to be sure, a certain naive optimism, which reminds us of Fermin in Bogota
half a century earlier. But the important thing is that we see a long-range (30 years!) policy,
consciously formulated and pursued, to turn 'idolaters,' not so much into Christians, as into
people culturally English, despite their irremediable colour and blood. A sort of mental
miscegenation is intended, which, when compared with Fermin's physical one, shows that,
like so much else in the Victorian age, imperialism made enormous progress in daintiness. In
any event, it can be safely said that from this point on, all over the expanding empire, if at
different speeds, Macaulayism was pursued.20 Like Russification, Anglicization naturally also
offered rosy [92] opportunities to armies of middle-class metropolitans (not least Scotsmen!)
- functionaries, schoolmasters, merchants, and planters -who quickly fanned out over the vast,
permanently sunlit realm. Nonetheless there was a central difference between the empires
ruled from St. Petersburg and London. Czardom remained a 'continuous' continental domain,
confined to the temperate and arctic zones of Eurasia. One could, so to speak, walk from one
end of it to the other. Linguistic kinship with the Slavic populations of Eastern Europe, and -
to put it pleasantly - historical, political, religious and economic ties with many non-Slavic
peoples, meant that relatively speaking, the barriers on the road to St. Petersburg were not
impermeable.21 The British Empire, on the other hand, was a grab-bag of primarily tropical
possessions scattered over every continent. Only a minority of the subjected peoples had any
long-standing religious, linguistic, cultural, or even political and economic, ties with the
metropole. Juxtaposed to one another in the Jubilee Year, they resembled those random
collections of Old Masters hastily assembled by English and American millionaires which
eventually turn into solemnly imperial state museums.
The consequences are well illustrated by the bitter recollections of Bipin Chandra Pal, who,
in 1932, a century after Macaulay's 'Minute', still felt angry enough to write that Indian
Magistrates:22
had not only passed a very rigid test on the same terms as British members of the service, but had
spent the very best years of the formative period of their youth in England. Upon their return to
their homeland, they practically lived in the same style as their brother Civilians, and almost
religiously followed the social conventions and the ethical standards of the latter. In those days the
India-born [sic - compare our Spanish-American Creoles] Civilian practically cut himself off from
his parent society, and lived and moved and had his being in the atmosphere so beloved of his
British colleagues. In mind and manners he was as much an Englishman as any Englishman. It
was no small sacrifice for him, because in this way he completely estranged himself from the
society of his own people and became socially and morally a pariah [93] among them.... He was as
much a stranger in his own native land as the European residents in the country.
So far, so Macaulay. Much more serious, however, was that such strangers in their native
land were still condemned-no less fatally than the American Creoles- to an 'irrational'
permanent subordination to the English maturrangos. It was not simply that, no matter how
Anglicized a Pal became, he was always barred from the uppermost peaks of the Raj. He was
also barred from movement outside its perimeter - laterally, say, to the Gold Coast or Hong
Kong, and vertically to the metropole. 'Completely estranged from the society of his own
people' he might be, but he was under life sentence to serve among them. (To be sure, who
'they' included varied with the stretch of British conquests on the subcontinent.23)
We shall be looking later at the consequences of official nationalisms for the rise of
twentieth-century Asian and African nationalisms. For our purposes here, what needs to be
stressed is that Anglicization produced thousands of Pals all over the world. Nothing more
sharply underscores the fundamental contradiction of English official nationalism, i.e. the
inner incompatibility of empire and nation. I say 'nation' advisedly, because it is always
tempting to account for these Pals in terms of racism. No one in their right mind would deny
the profoundly racist character of nineteenth-century English imperialism. But the Pals also
existed in the white colonies - Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa. English and
Scottish schoolmasters also swarmed there, and Anglicization was also cultural policy. As to
Pal, to them too the looping upward path still open to the Scots in the eighteenth century was
closed. Anglicized Australians did not serve in Dublin or Manchester, and not even in Ottawa
or Capetown. Nor, until quite late on, could they become Governors-[94]General in
Canberra.24 Only 'English English' did, i.e. members of a half-concealed English nation.
Three years before the East India Company lost its Indian hunting-ground, Commodore Perry
with his black ships peremptorily battered down the walls that for so long had kept Japan in
self-imposed isolation. After 1854, the self-confidence and inner legitimacy of the Bakufu
(Tokugawa Shogunate regime) were rapidly undermined by a conspicuous impotence in the
face of the penetrating West. Under the banner of Sonno Joi (Revere the Sovereign, Expel the
Barbarians), a small band of middle-ranking samurai, primarily from the Satsuma and
Choshu han, finally overthrew it in 1868. Among the reasons for their success was an
exceptionally creative absorption, especially after 1860, of the new Western military science
systematized since 1815 by Prussian and French staff professionals. They were thus able to
make effective use of 7,300 ultra-modern rifles (most of them American Civil War scrap),
purchased from an English arms-merchant.25 'In the use of guns... the [95] men of Choshu had
such mastery that the old blood and thunder slash and cut methods were quite useless against
them.'25
Once in power, however, the rebels, whom we remember today as the Meiji oligarchs, found
that their military prowess did not automatically guarantee political legitimacy. If the Tenno
('Emperor') could quickly be restored with the abolition of the Bakufu, the barbarians could
not so easily be expelled.27 Japan's geopolitical security remained just as fragile as before
1868. One of the basic means adopted for consolidating the oligarchy's domestic position was
thus a variant of mid-century 'official nationalism,' rather consciously modelled on
Hohenzollern Prussia-Germany. Between 1868 and 1871, all residual local 'feudal' military
units were dissolved, giving Tokyo a centralized monopoly of the means of violence. In 1872,
an Imperial Rescript ordered the promotion of universal literacy among adult males. In 1873,
well before the United Kingdom, Japan introduced conscription. At the same time, the regime
liquidated the samurai as a legally-defined and privileged class, an essential step not only for
(slowly) opening the officer corps to all talents, but also to fit the now 'available' nation-ofcitizens
model. The Japanese peasantry was freed from subjection to the feudal /Mn-system
and henceforth exploited directly by the state and commercial-agricultural landowners.28 In
1889, there followed a Prussian-style constitution and eventually universal male suffrage.
In this orderly campaign the men of Meiji were aided by three half-fortuitous factors. First
was the relatively high degree of Japanese ethnocultural homogeneity resulting from two and
a half centuries of isolation and internal pacification by the Bakufu. While the Japanese
spoken in Kyushu was largely incomprehensible in [96] Honshu, and even Edo-Tokyo and
Kyoto-Osaka found verbal communication problematic, the half-Sinified ideographic
reading-system was long in place throughout the islands, and thus the development of mass
literacy through schools and print was easy and uncontroversial. Second, the unique antiquity
of the imperial house (Japan is the only country whose monarchy has been monopolized by a
single dynasty throughout recorded history), and its emblematic Japanese-ness (contrast
Bourbons and Habsburgs), made the exploitation of the Emperor for official-nationalist
purposes rather simple.29 Third, the penetration of the barbarians was abrupt, massive, and
menacing enough for most elements of the politically-aware population to rally behind a
programme of self-defence conceived in the new national terms. It is worth emphasizing that
this possibility had everything to do with the timing of Western penetration, i.e. the 1860s as
opposed to the 1760s. For by then, in dominant Europe, the 'national community' had been
coming into its own for half a century, in both popular and official versions. In effect, selfdefence
could be fashioned along lines and in accordance with what were coming to be
'international norms.'
That the gamble paid off, in spite of the terrible sufferings imposed on the peasantry by the
ruthless fiscal exactions required to pay for a munitions-based programme of
industrialization, was certainly due in part to the single-minded determination of the oligarchs
themselves. Fortunate to come to power in an era in which numbered accounts in Zurich lay
in an undreamed-of future, they were not tempted to move the exacted surplus outside Japan.
Fortunate to rule in an age when military technology was still advancing at a relative amble,
they were able, with their catch-up armaments programme, to turn Japan into an independent
military power by the end of the century. Spectular successes by Japan's conscript army
against China in 1894-5, and by her navy against Czardom in 1905, plus the annexation of
Taiwan (1895) and Korea (1910), all consciously [97] propagandized through schools and
print, were extremely valuable in creating the general impression that the conservative
oligarchy was an authentic representative of the nation of which Japanese were coming to
imagine themselves members.
That this nationalism took on an aggressive imperialist character, even outside ruling circles,
can best be accounted for by two factors: the legacy of Japan's long isolation and the power
of the official-national model. Maruyama shrewdly points out that all nationalisms in Europe
arose in the context of a traditional pluralism of interacting dynastic states-as I put it earlier,
Latin's European universalism never had a political correlate:30
National consciousness in Europe therefore bore from its inception the imprint of a consciousness
of international society. It was a self-evident premise that disputes among sovereign states were
conflicts among independent members of this international society. Precisely for this reason war,
since Grotius, has come to occupy an important and systematic place in international law.
Centuries of Japanese isolation, however, meant that:31
an awareness of equality in international affairs was totally absent. The advocates of expulsion [of
the barbarians] viewed international relations from positions within the national hierarchy based on
the supremacy of superiors over inferiors. Consequently, when the premises of the national
hierarchy were transferred horizontally into the international sphere, international problems were
reduced to a single alternative: conquer or be conquered. In the absence of any higher normative
standards with which to gauge international relations, power politics is bound to be the rule and
yesterday's timid defensiveness will become today's unrestrained expansionism.
Secondly, the oligarchy's prime models were the self-naturalizing dynasties of Europe.
Insofar as these dynasties were more and more defining themselves in national terms, while at
the same time [98] expanding their power outside Europe, it is not surprising that the model
should have been understood imperially.32 As the parcellization of Africa at the Congress of
Berlin (1885) showed, great nations were global conquerors. How plausible then to argue
that, for Japan to be accepted as 'great,' she too should turn Tenno into Emperor and launch
overseas adventures, even if she was late to the game and had a lot of catching up to do. Few
things give one a sharper sense of the way these residues impinged on the consciousness of
the reading population than the following formulation by the radical-nationalist ideologue and
revolutionary Kita Ikki (1884-1937), in his very influential Nihon Kaizo Hoan Taiko [Outline
for the Reconstruction of Japan], published in 1924:33
As the class struggle within a nation is waged for the readjustment of unequal distinctions, so war
between nations for an honorable cause will reform the present unjust distinctions. The British
Empire is a millionaire possessing wealth all over the world; and Russia is a great landowner in
occupation of the northern half of the globe. Japan with her scattered fringe [sic] of islands is one
of the proletariat, and she has the right to declare war on the big monopoly powers. The socialists
of the West contradict themselves when they admit the right of class struggle to the proletariat at
home and at the same time condemn war, waged by a proletariat among nations, as militarism and
aggression ... If it is permissible for the working class to unite to overthrow unjust authority by
bloodshed, then unconditional approval should be given to Japan to perfect her army and navy and
make war for the rectification of unjust international frontiers. In the name of rational social
democracy Japan claims possession of Australia and Eastern Siberia.
It remains only to add that, as the empire expanded after 1900, Japanification a la Macaulay
was selfconsciously pursued as state policy. In the interwar years Koreans, Taiwanese and
Manchurians, [99] and, after the outbreak of the Pacific War, Burmese, Indonesians and
Filipinos, were subjected to policies for which the European model was an established
working practice. And just as in the British Empire, Japanified Koreans, Taiwanese or
Burmese had their passages to the metropole absolutely barred. They might speak and read
Japanese perfectly, but they would never preside over prefectures in Honshu, or even be
posted outside their zones of origin.
Having considered these three varied cases of'official nationalism', it is important to stress
that the model could be selfconsciously followed by states with no serious great power
pretensions, so long as they were states in which the ruling classes or leading elements in
them felt threatened by the world-wide spread of the nationally-imagined community. A
comparison between two such states, Siam and Hungary-within-Austro-Hungary, may prove
instructive.
Meiji's contemporary, the long-reigning Chulalongkorn (r. 1868-1910), defended his realm
from Western expansionism in a style that differed markedly from that of his Japanese
opposite number.34 Squeezed between British Burma and Malaya, and French Indochina, he
devoted himself to a shrewd manipulative diplomacy rather than attempting to build up a
serious war machine. (A Ministry of War was not established until 1894.) In a way that
reminds one of eighteenth-century Europe, his armed forces were primarily a motley array of
Vietnamese, Khmer, Lao, Malay, and Chinese mercenaries and tributaries. Nor was anything
much done to push an official nationalism through a modernized educational system. Indeed,
primary education was not made compulsory till more than a decade after his death, and the
country's first university was not set up until 1917, four decades after the founding of the
Imperial University in Tokyo. Nonetheless, Chulalongkorn regarded himself as a modernizer.
But his prime models were not the United Kingdom or Germany, but rather the colonial
beamtenstaaten of the Dutch East [100] Indies, British Malaya, and the Raj.35 Following these
models meant rationalizing and centralizing royal government, eliminating traditional semiautonomous
tributary statelets, and promoting economic development somewhat along
colonial lines. The most striking example of this - an example which in its odd way looks
forward to contemporary Saudi Arabia - was his encouragement of a massive immigration of
young, single, male foreigners to form the disoriented, politically powerless workforce
needed to construct port facilities, build railway lines, dig canals, and expand commercial
agriculture. This importing of gastarbeiter paralleled, indeed was modelled on, the policies of
the authorities in Batavia and Singapore. And as in the case of the Netherlands Indies and
British Malaya, the great bulk of the labourers imported during the nineteenth century were
from southeastern China. It is instructive that this policy caused him neither personal qualms
nor political difficulties - no more than it did the colonial rulers on whom he modelled
himself. Indeed the policy made good short term sense for a dynastic state, since it created an
impotent working class 'outside' Thai society and left that society largely 'undisturbed.'
Wachirawut, his son and successor (r. 1910-1925), had to pick up the pieces, modelling
himself this time on the self-naturalizing dynasts of Europe. Although - and because - he was
educated in late Victorian England, he dramatized himself as his country's 'first nationalist.'36
The target of this nationalism, however, was neither the United Kingdom, which controlled
90 per cent of Siam's trade, nor France, which had recently made off with easterly segments
of the old realm: it was the Chinese whom his father had so recently and blithely imported.
The style of his anti-Chinese stance is suggested by the titles of two of his most famous
pamphlets: The Jews of the Orient (1914), and Clogs on Our Wheels (1915).
[101] Why the change? Doubtless dramatic events immediately preceding and following his
coronation in November 1910 had their effect. The previous June the police had had to be
called out to suppress a general stike by Bangkok's Chinese merchants (upwardly mobile
children of early immigrants) and workers, marking their initiation into Siamese politics.37
The following year, the Celestial Monarchy in Peking was swept away by a heterogeneous
assortment of groups from which merchants were by no means absent. 'The Chinese' thus
appeared as harbingers of a popular republicanism profoundly threatening to the dynastic
principle. Second, as the words 'Jews' and 'Orient' suggest, the Anglicized monarch had
imbibed the particular racisms of the English ruling class. But, in addition, there was the fact
that Wachirawut was a sort of Asian Bourbon. In a pre-national era his ancestors had readily
taken attractive Chinese girls as wives and concubines, with the result that, Mendelianlyspeaking,
he himself had more Chinese 'blood' than Thai.38
Here is a fine example of the character of official nationalism - an anticipatory strategy
adopted by dominant groups which are threatened with marginalization or exclusion from an
emerging nationally-imagined community. (It goes without saying that Wachirawut also
began moving all the policy levers of official nationalism: compulsory state-controlled
primary education, state-organized propaganda, official rewriting of history, militarism - here
more visible show than the real thing - and endless affirmations of the identity of dynasty and
nation.39)
The development of Hungarian nationalism in the nineteenth century [102] shows in a
different way the imprint of the 'official' model. We noted earlier the Latin-speaking Magyar
nobility's enraged opposition to Joseph II's attempt in the 1780s to make German the sole
imperial language-of-state. The more advantaged segments of this class feared losing their
sinecures under a centralized, streamlined administration dominated by imperial-German
bureaucrats. The lower echelons were panicked by the possibility of losing their exemptions
from taxes and compulsory military service, as well as their control over the serfs and rural
counties. Yet alongside the defence of Latin, Magyar was, quite opportunistically, spoken for,
'since in the long run a Magyar administration seemed the only workable alternative to a
German one.'40 Bela Griinwald sardonically noted that 'the same counties which (arguing
against the decree of the Emperor) emphasized the possibility of an administration in the
Magyar tongue, decared it in 1811-that is, twenty-seven years later-an impossibility.' Two
decades later still, in a very 'nationalistic' Hungarian county it was said that 'the introduction
of the Magyar language would endanger our constitution and all our interests.'41 It was really
only in the 1840s that the Magyar nobility-a class consisting of about 136,000 souls
monopolizing land and political rights in a country of eleven million people42 - became
seriously committed to Magyarization, and then only to prevent its own historic
marginalization.
At the same time, slowly increasing literacy (by 1869 one third of the adult population), the
spread of print-Magyar, and the growth [103] of a small, but energetic, liberal intelligentsia
all stimulated a popular Hungarian nationalism conceived very differently from that of the
nobility. This popular nationalism, symbolized for later generations by the figure of Lajos
Kossuth (1802-1894), had its hour of glory in the Revolution of 1848. The revolutionary
regime not only got rid of the imperial governors appointed by Vienna, but abolished
the supposedly Ur-Magyar feudal Diet of Noble Counties, and proclaimed reforms to
put an end to serfdom and noblemen's tax-exempt status, as well as to curb drastically the
entailment of estates. In addition, it was decided that all Hungarian-speakers should be
Hungarian (as only the privileged had been before) and every Hungarian should speak
Magyar (as only some Magyars had hitherto been accustomed to do). As Ignotus drily
comments, 'The "nation" was, by the standard of that time (which viewed the rise of the twin
stars of Liberalism and Nationalism with boundless optimism), justified in feeling itself
extremely generous when it "admitted" the Magyar peasant with no discrimination save for
that relating to property;43 and the non-Magyar Christians on condition they became Magyar;
and eventually, with some reluctance and a delay of twenty years, the Jews.>44 Kossuth's own
position, in his fruitless negotiations with leaders of the various non-Magyar minorities, was
that these peoples should have exactly the same civil rights as the Magyars, but that since
they lacked 'historical personalities' they could not form nations on their own. Today, this
position may seem a trifle arrogant. It will appear in a better light if we recall that the
brilliant, young, radical-nationalist poet Sandor Petofi (1823-1849), a leading spirit of 1848,
on one occasion referred to the minorities as 'ulcers on the body of the motherland.'45
After the suppression of the revolutionary regime by Czarist armies in August 1849, Kossuth
went into life-long exile. The stage was now set for a revival of 'official' Magyar nationalism,
epitomized by the reactionary regimes of Count Kdlman Tisza [104] (1875-1890) and his son
Istvan (1903-1906). The reasons for this revival are very instructive. During the 1850s, the
authoritarian-bureaucratic Bach administration in Vienna combined severe political
repression with a firm implementation of certain social and economic policies proclaimed by
the revolutionaries of 1848 (most notably the abolition of serfdom and noblemen's taxexempt
status) and the promotion of modernized communications and large-scale capitalist
enterprise.46 Largely deprived of its feudal privileges and security, and incapable of
competing economically with the great latifundists and energetic German and Jewish
entrepreneurs, the old middle and lower Magyar nobility declined into an angry, frightened
rural gentry.
Luck, however, was on their side, Humiliatingly defeated by Prussian armies on the field of
Koniggratz in 1866, Vienna was forced to accede to the institution of the Dual Monarchy in
the Ausgleich (Compromise) of 1867. From then on, the Kingdom of Hungary enjoyed a very
considerable autonomy in the running of its internal affairs. The initial beneficiaries of the
Ausgleich were a group of liberal-minded high Magyar aristocrats and educated
professionals. In 1868, the administration of the cultivated magnate Count Gyula Andrassy
enacted a Nationalities Law which gave the non-Magyar minorities 'every right they had ever
claimed or could have claimed - short of turning Hungary into a federation.'47 But Tisza's
accession to the premiership in 1875 opened an era in which the reactionary gentry
successfully reconstituted their position, relatively free from Viennese interference.
In the economic field, the Tisza regime gave the great agrarian magnates a free hand,48 but
political power was essentially monopolized by the gentry. For,
[105] there remained only one refuge for the dispossessed: the administrative network of national
and local government and the army. For these, Hungary needed a tremendous staff; and if she did
not she could at least pretend to. Half the country consisted of'nationalities'to be kept in check. To
pay a host of reliable, Magyar, gentlemanly country magistrates to control them, so the argument
ran, was a modest price for the national interest. The problem of multi-nationalities was also a
godsend; it excused the proliferation of sinecures.
Thus 'the magnates held their entailed estates; the gentry held their entailed jobs.'49 Such was
the social basis for a pitiless policy of enforced Magyarization which after 1875 made the
Nationalities Law a dead letter. Legal narrowing of the suffrage, proliferation of rotten
boroughs, rigged elections, and organized political thuggery in the rural areas50
simultaneously consolidated the power of Tisza and his constituency and underscored the
'official' character of their nationalism.
Jdszi rightly compares this late-nineteenth-century Magyarization to 'the policy of Russian
Tsardom against the Poles, the Finns, and the Ruthenians; the policy of Prussia against the
Poles and Danes; and the policy of feudal England against the Irish.'51 The nexus of reaction
and official nationalism is nicely illustrated by these facts: while linguistic Magyarization
was a central element of regime policy, by the end of the 1880s only 2 per cent of the
officials in the more important branches of central and local governments were Romanian,
although Romanians constituted 20 per cent of the population, and 'even these 2 per cent are
employed in the lowest grades.>52 On the other hand, in [106] the Hungarian parliament prior
to World War I, there was 'not a single representative of the working classes and of the
landless peasantry (the great majority of the country)... and there were only 8 Romanians and
Slovaks out of a total membership of 413 in a country in which only 54 per cent of the
inhabitants spoke Magyar as their mother-tongue.'53 Small wonder, then, that when Vienna
sent in troops to dissolve this parliament in 1906, 'not even a single mass-meeting, a single
placard, or a single popular proclamation protested against the new era of "Viennese
absolutism." On the contrary the working masses and nationalities regarded with malicious
joy the impotent struggle of the national oligarchy.'54
The triumph of the reactionary Magyar gentry's 'official nationalism' after 1875 cannot,
however, be explained solely by that group's own political strength, nor by the freedom of
manoeuvre it inherited from the Ausgleich. The fact is that until 1906 the Habsburg court did
not feel in a position to assert itself decisively against a regime which in many respects
remained a pillar of the empire. Above all, the dynasty was incapable of superimposing a
strenuous official nationalism of its own. Not merely because the regime was, in the words of
the eminent socialist Viktor Adler, 'Absolutismus gemildert durch Schlamperei [absolutism
tempered by slovenliness].'55 [107] Later than almost anywhere else, the dynasty clung to
vanished conceptions. 'In his religious mysticism, each Habsburg felt himself connected by a
special tie with divinity, as an executor of the divine will. This explains their almost
unscrupulous attitude in the midst of historical catastrophes, and their proverbial
ungratefulness. DerDank vom Hause Habsburg became a widely spread slogan.'56 In addition,
bitter jealousy of Hohenzollern Prussia, which increasingly made off with the plate of the
Holy Roman Empire and turned itself into Germany, kept the dynasty insisting on Franz II 's
splendid 'patriotism for me.'
At the same time, it is interesting that in its last days the dynasty discovered, perhaps to its
own surprise, affinities with its Social Democrats, to the point that some of their common
enemies spoke sneeringly of 'Burgsozialismus [Court Socialism]'. In this tentative coalition
there was doubtless a mixture of Machiavellism and idealism on each side. One can see this
mixture in the vehement campaign led by the Austrian Social Democrats against the
economic and military 'separatism' pressed by the regime of Count Istvan Tisza in 1905. Karl
Renner, for example, 'chastized the cowardice of the Austrian bourgeoisie who began to
acquiesce in the separatistic plans of the Magyars, though "the Hungarian market is
incomparably more significant for Austrian capital than [the] Moroccan is for the German,"
which German foreign policy defends so energetically. In the claim for an independent
Hungarian customs territory he saw nothing else than the clamouring of city sharks,
swindlers, and political demagogues, against the very interests of Austrian industry, of the
Austrian working-classes, and of the Hungarian agricultural population.'57 Similarly, Otto
Bauer wrote that:58
[108] In the era of the Russian revolution [of 1905], no one will dare to use naked military force to
subjugate the country [Hungary], rent as it is by class and national antagonisms. But the inner
conflicts of the country will provide the Crown with another instrument of power which it will
have to exploit if it does not wish to suffer the fate of the House of Bernadotte. It can not be the
organ of two wills and yet still intend to rule over Hungary and Austria. Hence it must take steps to
ensure that Hungary and Austria have a common will, and that it constructs a single realm [Reich].
Hungary's inward fragmentation offers her the possibility to achieve this goal. She will dispatch
her army to Hungary to recapture it for the realm, but she will inscribe on her banners:
Uncorrupted, universal and equal suffrage! Right of coalition for the agricultural laborer! National
autonomy! She will counterpose to the idea of an independent Hungarian nation-state
[Nationahtaat] the idea of the United States of Great Austria [sic], the idea of a federative state
[Bundesstaat], in which each nation will administer independently its own national affairs, and all
the nations will unite in one state for the preservation of their common interests. Inevitably and
unavoidably, the idea of a federative state of nationalities [Nationalitdtenbundesstaat] will become
an instrument of the Crown [sic!- Werkzeug der Krone], whose realm is being destroyed by the
decay of Dualism.
It seems reasonable to detect in this United States of Great Austria (USGA) residues of the
USA and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (one day to be ruled by a
Labour Party), as well as a foreshadowing of a Union of Soviet Socialist Republics whose
stretch is strangely reminiscent of Czardom's. The fact is that this USGA seemed, in its
imaginer's mind, the necessary heir of a particular dynastic dominion (Great Austria) - with
its enfranchised components exactly those produced by centuries of Habsburg 'hucksterings'.
Such 'imperial' imaginings were partly the misfortune of a socialism born in the capital of
one of Europe's great dynastic [109] empires.59 As we have noted earlier, the new imagined
communities (including the still-born, but still imagined USGA) conjured up by lexicography
and print-capitalism always regarded themselves as somehow ancient. In an age in which
'history' itself was still widely conceived in terms of'great events' and 'great leaders', pearls
strung along a thread of narrative, it was obviously tempting to decipher the community's past
in antique dynasties. Hence a USGA in which the membrane separating empire from nation,
crown from proletariat, is almost transparent. Nor was Bauer unusual in all this. A William
the Conqueror and a George I, neither of whom could speak English, continue to appear
unproblematically as beads in the necklace 'Kings of England'. 'Saint' Stephen (r. 1001-1038)
might admonish his successor that:60
The utility of foreigners and guests is so great that they can be given a place of sixth importance
among the royal ornaments.... For, as the guests come from various regions and provinces, they
bring with them various languages and customs, various knowledges and arms. All these adorn the
royal court, heighten its splendour, and terrify the haughtiness of foreign powers. For a country
unified in language and customs is fragile and weak....
But such words would not in the least prevent his subsequent apotheosis as the First King of
Hungary.
In conclusion, then it has been argued that from about the middle of the nineteenth century
there developed what Seton-Watson terms 'official nationalisms' inside Europe. These
nationalisms were historically 'impossible' until after the appearance of popular linguisticnationalisms,
for, at bottom, they were responses by power-groups - primarily, but not
exclusively, dynastic and aristocratic – [110] threatened with exclusion from, or
marginalization in, popular imagined communities. A sort of tectonic upheaval was
beginning, which, after 1918 and 1945, tipped these groups towards drainages in Estoril and
Monte Carlo. Such official nationalisms were conservative, not to say reactionary, policies,
adapted from the model of the largely spontaneous popular nationalisms that preceded them.61
Nor were they ultimately confined to Europe and the Levant. In the name of imperialism,
very similar policies were pursued by the same sorts of groups in the vast Asian and African
territories subjected in the course of the nineteenth century.62 Finally, refracted into non-
European cultures and histories, they were picked up and imitated by indigenous ruling
groups in those few zones (among them Japan and Siam) which escaped direct subjection.
In almost every case, official nationalism concealed a discrepancy between nation and
dynastic realm. Hence a world-wide contradiction: Slovaks were to be Magyarized, Indians
Anglicized, and Koreans Japanified, but they would not be permitted to join pilgrimages
which would allow them to administer Magyars, Englishmen, or Japanese. The banquet to
which they were invited always turned out to be a Barmecide feast. The reason for all this
was [111] not simply racism; it was also the fact that at the core of the empires nations too
were emerging-Hungarian, English, and Japanese. And these nations were also instinctively
resistant to 'foreign' rule. Imperialist ideology in the post-1850 era thus typically had the
character of a conjuring-trick. How much it was a conjuring-trick is suggested by the
equanimity with which metropolitan popular classes eventually shrugged off the 'losses' of
the colonies, even in cases like Algeria where the colony had been legally incorporated into
the metropole. In the end, it is always the ruling classes, bourgeois certainly, but above all
aristocratic, that long mourn the empires, and their grief always has a stagey quality to it.
1. It is nice that what eventually became the late British Empire has not been ruled by an 'English' dynasty since
the early eleventh century: since then a motley parade of Normans (Plantagenets), Welsh (Tudors), Scots
(Stuarts), Dutch (House of Orange) and Germans (Hanoverians) have squatted on the imperial throne. No one
much cared until the philological revolution and a paroxysm of English nationalism in World War I. House of
Windsor rhymes with House of Schonbrunn or House of Versailles.

4. One could argue that a long era closed in 1844, when Magyar finally replaced Latin as language-of-state in
the Kingdom of Hungary. But, as we have seen, dog-Latin was in fact the vernacular of the Magyar middle and
lower nobility until well into the nineteenth century.

25. Here the key figure was Omura Masujiro (1824-1869), the so-called 'Father of the Japanese Army". A lowranking
Choshu samurai, he started his career by studying Western medicine through Dutch-language manuals.
(It will be recalled that until 1854 the Dutch were the only Westerners permitted access to Japan, and this access
was limited essentially to the island of Deshima off the Bakufu-controlled port of Nagasaki.) On graduating
from the Tekijyuku in Osaka, then the best Dutch-language training centre in the country, he returned home to
practise medicine - but without much success. In 1853, he took a position in Uwajima as instructor in Western
learning, with a foray to Nagasaki to study naval science. (He designed and supervised the building of Japan's
first steamship on the basis of written manuals.) His chance came after Perry's arrival; he moved to Edo in 1856
to work as an instructor at what would become the National Military Academy and at the Bakufu's top research
office for the study of Western texts. His translations of European military works especially on Napoleon's
innovations in strategy and tactics, won him fame and recall to Choshu in 1860 to serve as military adviser. In
1864-65, he proved the relevance of his writing as a successful commander in the Choshu civil war.
Subsequently he became the first Meiji Minister of War, and drew up the regime's revolutionary plans for mass
conscription and elimination of the samurai as a legal caste. For his pains he was assassinated by an outraged
samurai. See Albert M. Craig, Choshu in the Meiji Restoration, especially pp. 202-204, 267-280.

Hungarian parliament to fight for Kossuth's ideas, particularly on the minorities question. His speeches
denouncing Tisza's blatant violations of the 1868 Nationalities Law led first to his physical extrusion from
parliament and then expulsion from his own party. In 1888, he was returned to parliament from a wholly
Romanian constituency and became largely a political outcast. Ignotus, Hungary, p. 109.

61. Half a century ago Jaszi had already suspected as much: 'One may ask whether the late imperialist

286. Emphasis added.
62. The point is nicely underlined by inversion in the case of the Netherlands Indies, which in its last days was
still to a large extent ruled through a language which we know today as 'Indonesian.' This is, I think, the only
case of a large colonial possession in which to the end a non-European language remained a language-of-state.
The anomaly is primarily to be explained by the sheer antiquity of the colony, which was founded early in the
seventeenth century by a corporation (the Vereenigde Oostindische Compagnie)-long before the age of official
nationalism. Doubtless there was also a certain lack of confidence on the part of the Dutch in modern times that
their language and culture had a European cachet comparable to that of English, French, German, Spanish, or
Italian. (Belgians in the Congo would use French rather than Flemish.) Finally, colonial educational policy was
exceptionally conservative: in 1940, when the indigenous population numbered well over 70 millions, there
were only 637 'natives' in college, and only 37 graduated with BAs. See George McT. Kahin, Nationalism and
Revolution in Indonesia, p. 32. For more on the Indonesian case, see below, Chapter VII.
7. The Last Wave
[113] The First World War brought the age of high dynasticism to an end. By 1922,
Habsburgs, Hohenzollerns, Romanovs and Ottomans were gone. In place of the Congress of
Berlin came the League of Nations, from which non-Europeans were not excluded. From this
time on, the legitimate international norm was the nation-state, so that in the League even the
surviving imperial powers came dressed in national costume rather than imperial uniform.
After the cataclysm of World War II the nation-state tide reached full flood. By the mid-
1970s even the Portuguese Empire had become a thing of the past.
The new states of the post-World War II period have their own character, which nonetheless
is incomprehensible except in terms of the succession of models we have been considering.
One way of underlining this ancestry is to remind ourselves that a very large number of these
(mainly non-European) nations came to have European languages-of-state. If they resembled
the 'American' model in this respect, they took from linguistic European nationalism its
ardent populism, and from official nationalism its Russifying policy-orientation. They did so
because Americans and Europeans had lived through complex historical experiences which
were now everywhere modularly imagined, and because the European languages-of-state they
employed were the legacy of imperialist official nationalism. This is why so often in the
'nation-building' policies of [114] the new states one sees both a genuine, popular nationalist
enthusiasm and a systematic, even Machiavellian, instilling of nationalist ideology through
the mass media, the educational system, administrative regulations, and so forth. In turn, this
blend of popular and official nationalism has been the product of anomalies created by
European imperialism: the well-known arbitrariness of frontiers, and bilingual intelligentsias
poised precariously over diverse monoglot populations. One can thus think of many of these
nations as projects the achievement of which is still in progress, yet projects conceived more
in the spirit of Mazzini than that of Uvarov.
In considering the origins of recent 'colonial nationalism', one central similarity with the
colonial nationalisms of an earlier age immediately strikes the eye: the isomorphism between
each nationalism's territorial stretch and that of the previous imperial administrative unit. The
similarity is by no means fortuitous; it is clearly related to the geography of all colonial
pilgrimages. The difference lies in the fact that the contours of eighteenth-century Creole
pilgrimages were shaped not only by the centralizing ambitions of metropolitan absolutism,
but by real problems of communication and transportation, and a general technological
primitiveness. In the twentieth century, these problems had largely been overcome, and in
their place came a Janus-faced 'Russification'.
I argued earlier that in the late eighteenth century the imperial administrative unit came to
acquire a national meaning in part because it circumscribed the ascent of Creole
functionaries. So too in the twentieth century. For even in cases where a young brown or
black Englishman came to receive some education or training in the metropole, in a way that
few of his creole progenitors had been able to do, that was typically the last time he made this
bureaucratic pilgrimage. From then on, the apex of his looping flight was the highest
administrative centre to which he could be assigned: Rangoon, Accra, Georgetown, or
Colombo. Yet in each constricted journey he found bilingual travelling companions with
whom he came to feel a growing communality. In his journey he understood rather quickly
that his point of origin - conceived either ethnically, linguistically, or geographically - was of
small significance. At most it started him on this pilgrimage rather than that: it did not
fundamentally determine [115] his destination or his companions. Out of this pattern came
that subtle, half-concealed transformation, step by step, of the colonial-state into the nationalstate,
a transformation made possible not only by a solid continuity of personnel, but by the
established skein of journeys through which each state was experienced by its functionaries.1
Yet increasingly after the middle of the nineteenth century, and above all in the twentieth, the
journeys were no longer made by a mere handful of travellers, but rather by huge and
variegated crowds. The central factors at work were three. First and foremost was the
enormous increase in physical mobility made possible by the astonishing achievements of
industrial capitalism - railways and steamships in the last century, motor transport and
aviation in this. The interminable journeys of the old Americas were quickly becoming things
of the past.
Second, imperial 'Russification' had its practical as well as ideological side. The sheer size of
the global European empires, and the vast populations subjected, meant that purely
metropolitan, or even creole, bureaucracies were neither recruitable nor affordable. The
colonial state, and, somewhat later, corporate capital, needed armies of clerks, who to be
useful had to be bilingual, capable of mediating linguistically between the metropolitan
nation and the colonized peoples. The need was all the greater as the specialized functions of
the state everywhere multiplied after the turn of the century. Alongside the old district officer
appeared the medical officer, the irrigation engineer, the agricultural extension-worker, the
school-teacher, the policeman, and so on. With every enlargement of the state, the swarm of
its inner pilgrims swelled.2
[116] Third was the spread of modern-style education, not only by the colonial state, but also
by private religious and secular organizations. This expansion occurred not simply to provide
cadres for governmental and corporate hierarchies, but also because of the growing
acceptance of the moral importance of modern knowledge even for colonized populations.3
(Indeed the phenomenon of the educated unemployed was already beginning to be apparent
in a variety of colonial states.)
It is generally recognized that the intelligentsias were central to the rise of nationalism in the
colonial territories, not least because colonialism ensured that native agrarian magnates, big
merchants, industrial entrepreneurs, and even a large professional class were relative rarities.
Almost everywhere economic power was either monopolized by the colonialists themselves,
or unevenly shared with a politically impotent class of pariah (non-native) businessmen-
Lebanese, Indian and Arab in colonial Africa, Chinese, Indian, and Arab in colonial Asia. It
is no less generally recognized that the intelligentsias' vanguard role derived from their
bilingual literacy, or rather literacy and bilingualism. Print-literacy already made possible the
imagined community floating in homogeneous, empty time of which we have spoken earlier.
Bilingualism meant access, through the European language-of-state, to modern Western
culture in the broadest sense, and, in particular, to the models of nationalism, nation-ness, and
nation-state produced elsewhere in the course of the nineteenth century.4
In 1913, the Dutch colonial regime in Batavia, taking its lead from [117] The Hague,
sponsored massive colony-wide festivities to celebrate the centennial of the 'national
liberation' of the Netherlands from French imperialism. Orders went out to secure physical
participation and financial contributions, not merely from the local Dutch and Eurasian
communities, but also from the subject native population. In protest, the early Javanese-
Indonesian nationalist Suwardi Surjaning-rat (Ki Hadjar Dewantoro) wrote his famous
Dutch-language newspaper article 'Als ikeens Nederlander was' (If I were for once to be a
Dutchman).5
In my opinion, there is something out of place - something indecent - if we (I still being a
Dutchman in my imagination) ask the natives to join the festivities which celebrate our
independence. Firstly, we will hurt their sensitive feelings because we are here celebrating our own
independence in their native country which we colonize. At the moment we are very happy
because a hundred years ago we liberated ourselves from foreign domination; and all of this is
occurring in front of the eyes of those who are still under our domination. Does it not occur to us
that these poor slaves are also longing for such a moment as this, when they like us will be able to
celebrate their independence? Or do we perhaps feel that because of our soul-destroying policy we
regard all human souls as dead? If that is so, then we are deluding ourselves, because no matter
how primitive a community is, it is against any type of oppression. If I were a Dutchman, I would
not organize an independence celebration in a country where the independence of the people has
been stolen.
With these words Suwardi was able to turn Dutch history against the Dutch, by scraping
boldly at the weld between Dutch nationalism and imperialism. Furthermore, by the
imaginary transformation of [118] himself into a temporary Dutchman (which invited a
reciprocal transformation of his Dutch readers into temporary Indonesians), he undermined
all the racist fatalities that underlay Dutch colonial ideology.6
Suwardi's broadside - which delighted his Indonesian as much as it irritated his Dutch
audience-is exemplary of a world-wide twentieth-century phenomenon. For the paradox of
imperial official nationalism was that it inevitably brought what were increasingly thought of
and written about as European 'national histories' into the consciousnesses of the colonized -
not merely via occasional obtuse festivities, but also through reading-rooms and classrooms.7
Vietnamese youngsters could not avoid learning about the philosophes and the Revolution,
and what Debray calls 'our secular antagonism to Germany'.8 Magna Carta, the Mother of
Parliaments, and the Glorious Revolution, glossed as English national history, entered
schools all over the British Empire. Belgium's independence struggle against Holland was not
erasable from schoolbooks Congolese children would one day read. So also the histories of
the USA in the Philippines and, last of all, Portugal in Mozambique and Angola. The irony,
of course, is that these histories were written out of a historiographical consciousness which
by the turn of the century was, all over Europe,'becoming nationally defined. (The barons
who imposed Magna Carta on John Plantagenet did not speak 'English,' and had no
conception of themselves as 'Englishmen,' but they were firmly defined as early patriots in
the classrooms of the United Kingdom 700 years later.)
Yet there is a characteristic feature of the emerging nationalist intelligentsias in the colonies
which to some degree marks them off [119] from the vernacularizing nationalist
intelligentsias of nineteenth-century Europe. Almost invariably they were very young, and
attached a complex political significance to their youth-a significance which, though it has
changed over time, remains important to this day. The rise of (modern/organized) Burmese
nationalism is often dated to the founding in 1908 of the Young Men's Buddhist Association
in Rangoon; and of Malayan by the establishment in 1938 of the Kesatuan Melayu Muda
(Union of Malay Youth). Indonesians annually celebrate the Sumpah Pemuda (Oath of
Youth) drawn up and sworn by the nationalist youth congress of 1928. And so on. It is
perfectly true that in one sense Europe had been there before - if we think of Young Ireland,
Young Italy, and the like. Both in Europe and in the colonies 'young' and 'youth' signified
dynamism, progress, self-sacrificing idealism and revolutionary will. But in Europe 'young'
had little in the way of definable sociological contours. One could be middle-aged and still
part of Young Ireland; one could be illiterate and still part of Young Italy. The reason, of
course, was that the language of these nationalisms was either a vernacular mother-tongue to
which the members had spoken access from the cradle, or, as in the case of Ireland, a
metropolitan language which had sunk such deep roots in sections of the population over
centuries of conquest that it too could manifest itself, creole-style, as a vernacular. There was
thus no necessary connection between language, age, class, and status.
In the colonies things were very different. Youth meant, above all, the first generation in any
significant numbers to have acquired a European education, marking them off linguistically
and culturally from their parents' generation, as well from the vast bulk of their colonized
agemates (cf. B. C. Pal). Burma's 'English-language' YMBA, modelled in part on the YMCA,
was built by English-reading schoolboys. In the Netherlands Indies one finds, inter a/w, Jong
Java (Young Java), Jong Ambon (Young Amboina), and Jong Islamietenbond (League of
Young Muslims) - titles incomprehensible to any young native unacquainted with the
colonial tongue. In the colonies, then, by 'Youth' we mean 'Schooled Youth,' at least at the
start. This in turn reminds us again of the unique role played by [120] colonial schoolsystems
in promoting colonial nationalisms.9
The case of Indonesia affords a fascinatingly intricate illustration of this process, not least
because of its enormous size, huge population (even in colonial times), geographical
fragmentation (about 3,000 islands), religious variegation (Muslims, Buddhists, Catholics,
assorted Protestants, Hindu-Balinese, and 'animists'), and ethnolinguistic diversity (well over
100 distinct groups). Furthermore, as its hybrid pseudo-Hellenic name suggests, its stretch
does not remotely correspond to any precolonial domain; on the contrary, at least until
General Suharto's brutal invasion of ex-Portuguese East Timor in 1975, its boundaries have
been those left behind by the last Dutch conquests (c. 1910).
Some of the peoples on the eastern coast of Sumatra are not only physically close, across the
narrow Straits of Malacca, to the populations of the western littoral of the Malay Peninsula,
but they are ethnically related, understand each other's speech, have a common religion, and
so forth. These same Sumatrans share neither mother-tongue, ethnicity, nor religion with the
Ambonese, located [121] on islands thousands of miles away to the east. Yet during this
century they have come to understand the Ambonese as fellow-Indonesians, the Malays as
foreigners.
Nothing nurtured this bonding more than the schools that the regime in Batavia set up in
increasing numbers after the turn of the century. To see why, one has to remember that in
complete contrast to traditional, indigenous schools, which were always local and personal
enterprises (even if, in good Muslim fashion, there was plenty of horizontal movement of
students from one particularly well-reputed ulama-teacher to another), the government
schools formed a colossal, highly rationalized, tightly centralized hierarchy, structurally
analogous to the state bureaucracy itself. Uniform textbooks, standardized diplomas and
teaching certificates, a strictly regulated gradation of age-groups,10 classes and instructional
materials, in themselves created a self-contained, coherent universe of experience. But no less
important was the hierarchy's geography. Standardized elementary schools came to be
scattered about in villages and small townships of the colony; junior and senior middleschools
in larger towns and provincial centres; while tertiary education (the pyramid's apex)
was confined to the colonial capital of Batavia and the Dutch-built city of Bandung, 100
miles southwest in the cool Priangan highlands. Thus the twentieth-century colonial schoolsystem
brought into being pilgrimages which paralleled longer-established functionary
journeys. The Rome of these pilgrimages was Batavia: not Singapore, not Manila, not
Rangoon, not even the old Javanese royal capitals of Jogjakarta and Surakarta.11 From all
over the vast colony, but from nowhere outside it, the tender pilgrims made their inward,
upward way, meeting fellow-pilgrims from different, perhaps once hostile, villages in
primary school; from different ethnolinguistic groups in middle-school; and from every [122]
part of the realm in the tertiary institutions of the capital.12 And they knew that from wherever
they had come they still had read the same books and done the same sums. They also knew,
even if they never got so far - and most did not - that Rome was Batavia, and that all these
journeyings derived their 'sense' from the capital, in effect explaining why 'we' are 'here'
'together.' To put it another way, their common experience, and the amiably competitive
comradeship of the classroom, gave the maps of the colony which they studied (always
coloured differently from British Malaya or the American Philippines) a territorially specific
imagined reality which was every day confirmed by the accents and physiognomies of their
classmates.13
And what were they all together? The Dutch were quite clear on this point: whatever mothertongue
they spoke, they were irremediably inlanders, a word which, like the English 'natives'
and the French 'indigenes,' always carried an unintentionally paradoxical semantic load. In
this colony, as in each separate, other colony, it meant that the persons referred to were both
'inferior' and 'belonged there' (just as the Dutch, being 'natives' of Holland, belonged there).
Conversely, the Dutch by such language assigned themselves, along with superiority, 'notbelonging-
there'. The word also implied that in their common inferiority, the inlanders were
equally contemptible, no matter what ethnolinguistic group or class they came from. Yet even
this miserable equality of condition had a definite perimeter. For inlander always raised the
question 'native of what?'. If the Dutch sometimes spoke as if inlanders were a worldcategory,
experience showed that this notion was hardly sustainable in practice. Inlanders
stopped at the coloured colony's drawn edge. Beyond that were, variously, 'natives', indigenes
and indios. Moreover, colonial legal terminology included the category vreemde
oosterlingen (foreign Orientals), which had the dubious ring of false coin - as it were
'foreign natives.' Such 'foreign Orientals,' mainly Chinese, Arabs and Japanese, though they
might live in the colony, had a politico- [123] legal status superior to that of the 'native
natives'. Furthermore, tiny Holland was sufficiently awed by the Meiji oligarchs' economic
strength and military prowess for Japanese in the colony to be legally promoted, from 1899
on, to 'honorary Europeans'. From all this, by a sort of sedimentation, inlander - excluding
whites, Dutchmen, Chinese, Arabs, Japanese, 'natives,' indigenes, and indios - grew ever
more specific in content; until, like a ripe larva, it was suddenly transmogrified into the
spectacular butterfly called 'Indonesian'.
While it is true that the concepts inlander and 'native' could never be truly generalized racist
notions, since they always implied roots in some specific habitat,14 the case of Indonesia
should not lead us to assume that each 'native' habitat had preordained or immutable frontiers.
Two examples will show the contrary: French West Africa and French Indochina.
In its heyday, the Ecole Normale William Ponty in Dakar, though only a secondary school,
was still the apex of the colonial educational pyramid in French West Africa.15 To William
Ponty came intelligent students from what we know today as Guinea, Mali, the Ivory Coast,
Senegal, and so on. We should not be surprised therefore if the pilgrimages of these boys,
terminating in Dakar, were initially read in French [West] African terms, of which the
paradoxical concept negritude - essence of African-ness expressible only in French, language
of the William Ponty classrooms - is an unforgettable symbol. Yet the apicality of William
Ponty was accidental and evanescent. As more secondary schools were constructed in French
West Africa, it was no longer necessary for bright boys to make so distant a [124] pilgrimage.
And in any case the educational centrality of William Ponty was never matched by a
comparable administrative centrality of Dakar. The interchangeability of French West
African boys on the benches of William Ponty was not paralleled by their later bureaucratic
substitutability in the French West African colonial administration. Hence, the school's Old
Boys went home to become, eventually, Guinean or Malian nationalist leaders, while
retaining a 'West African' camaraderie and solidary intimacy lost to succeeding generations.16
In much the same way, for one generation of relatively well educated adolescents, the curious
hybrid 'Indochine' had a real, experienced, imagined meaning.17 This entity, it will be
recalled, was not legally proclaimed until 1887, and did not acquire its fullest territorial form
until 1907, though active French meddling in the general area went back a century earlier.
Broadly speaking, the educational policy pursued by the colonial rulers of 'Indochine' had two
fundamental purposes18 - both of which, as it turned out, contributed to the growth of an
'Indochinese' consciousness. One aim was to break existing politico-cultural ties between the
colonized peoples and the immediate extra-Indochinese [125] world. As far as 'Cambodge'
and 'Laos' were concerned,19 the target was Siam, which had previously exercised a variable
suzerainty over them and shared with both the rituals, institutions, and sacred language of
Hinayana Buddhism. (In addition, the language and script of the lowland Lao were, and are,
closely related to those of the Thai). It was precisely out of this concern that the French
experimented first in those zones last seized from Siam with the so-called 'renovated pagoda
schools,' which were designed to move Khmer monks and their pupils out of the Thai orbit
into that of Indochina.20
In eastern Indochina (my shorthand for 'Tonkin,' 'Annam,' and 'Cochin China'), the target was
China and Chinese civilization. Although the dynasties ruling in Hanoi and Hue had for
centuries defended their independence from Peking, they came to rule through a mandarinate
consciously modelled on that of the Chinese. Recruitment into the state machinery was
geared to written examinations in the Confucian classics; dynastic documents were written in
Chinese characters; and the ruling class was heavily Sinicized in culture. These long-standing
ties assumed an additionally unwelcome character after about 1895, when the writings of
such Chinese reformers as K'ang Yu-wei and Liang Ch'i-ch'ao, and nationalists like Sun Yatsen,
began seeping across the northern frontier of the colony.21
[126] Accordingly, Confucian examinations were successively abolished in 'Tonkin' in 1915
and in 'Annam' in 1918. Henceforth, recruitment into the civil services of Indochina was to
take place exclusively through a developing French colonial education system. Furthermore,
quoc ngu, a romanized phonetic script originally devised by Jesuit missionaries in the
seventeenth century,22 and adopted by the authorities for use in 'Cochin China' as early as the
1860s, was consciously promoted to break the links with China-and perhaps also with the
indigenous past-by making dynastic records and ancient literatures inaccessible to a new
generation of colonized Vietnamese.23
The second aim of educational policy was to produce a carefully-calibrated quantum of
French-speaking and French-writing Indo-chinese to serve as a politically reliable, grateful,
and acculturated indigenous elite, filling the subordinate echelons of the colony's bureaucracy
and larger commercial enterprises.24
The intricacies of the colonial educational system need not detain us here. For our present
purposes, the key characteristic of the system was that it formed a single, if ramshackle,
pyramid, of which, until the mid-1930s, the upper terraces all lay in the east. Up until then,
for [127] example, the only state-sponsored lycees were located in Hanoi and Saigon; and
throughout the prewar colonial period, the sole university in Indochina was located in Hanoi,
so to speak just down the street from the palace of the Governor-General.25 The climbers of
these terraces included all the major vernacular-speakers of the French domain: Vietnamese,
Chinese, Khmer, and Lao (and not a few young French colonials). For the climbers, coming
from, shall we say, My Tho, Battambang, Vientiane, and Vinh, the meaning of their
convergence had to be 'Indochinese,' in the same way that the polyglot and polyethnic student
body of Batavia and Bandung had to read theirs as 'Indonesian.'26 This Indochinese-ness,
although it was quite real, was nonetheless imagined by a tiny group, and not for very long.
Why did it turn out to be so evanescent, while Indonesian-ness survived and deepened?
First there was a marked change of course in colonial education, above all as applied in
eastern Indochina, from about 1917 on. The actual, or immediately impending, liquidation of
the traditional Confucian examination system persuaded more and more members of the
Vietnamese elite to try to place their children in the best French schools available, so as to
ensure their bureaucratic futures. The resulting competition for places in the few good
schools [128] available aroused a particularly strong reaction from the colons, who regarded
these schools as by right a largely French preserve. The colonial regime's solution to the
problem was to create a separate and subordinate 'Franco-Vietnamese' educational structure
which placed special emphasis, in its lower grades, on Vietnamese-language instruction in
quoc ngu (with French taught as a second language via the medium of quoc ngu).27 This
policy shift had two complementary results. On the one hand, government publication of
hundreds of thousands of quoc ngu primers significantly accelerated the spread of this
European-invented script, unintentionally helping to turn it, between 1920 and 1945, into the
popular medium for the expression of Vietnamese cultural (and national) solidarity.28 For
even if only 10 per cent of the Vietnamese-speaking population was literate by the late 1930s,
this was a proportion unprecedented in the history of this people. Moreover, these literates
were, unlike the Confucian literati, deeply committed to a rapid increase in their own
numbers. (Similarly, in 'Cambodge' and 'Laos', if on a more limited scale, the authorities
promoted the printing of elementary school-texts in the vernaculars, initially and mainly in
the traditional orthographies, later and more feebly in romanized scripts).29 On the other hand,
the policy worked to exclude non-native-Vietnamese-speakers residing in eastern Indochina.
In the case of the Khmer Krom of 'Cochin [129] China,' it worked, in combination with the
colonial regime's willingness to permit them to have 'Franco-Khmer' elementary schools like
those being encouraged in the Protectorate, to re-orient ambitions back up the Mekong. Thus
those Khmer Krom adolescents who aspired to higher education in the administrative capital
of Indochina (and, for a select few, even in metropolitan France) increasingly took the detour
via Phnom Penh rather than the highway through Saigon.
Second, in 1935 the College Sisowath in Phnom Penh was upgraded into a full-fledged state
lyc'ee, with a status equal to, and a curriculum identical with, those of the existing state
lycées in Saigon and Hanoi. Although its students were at first drawn heavily (in the tradition
of the College) from local Sino-Khmer merchant families and those of resident Vietnamese
functionaries, the proportion of native Khmers steadily increased.30 It is probably fair to say
that, after 1940, the great bulk of Khmer-speaking adolescents who achieved a solid French
high-school education did so in the neat colonial capital the colonialists had built for the
Norodoms.
Third was the fact that there was no real isomorphism between the educational and
administrative pilgrimages in Indochina. The French made no bones about expressing the
view that if the Vietnamese were untrustworthy and grasping, they were nonetheless
decisively more energetic and intelligent than the 'child-like' Khmer and Lao. Accordingly,
they made extensive use of Vietnamese functionaries in western Indochina.31 The 176,000
Vietnamese residing in 'Cambodge' in 1937-representing less than one per cent of the 19
million Vietnamese-speakers of the colony, but about 6 per cent of the Protectorate's
population - formed a relatively successful group, for whom therefore Indochina had a rather
solid meaning, as it did for [130] the 50,000 sent into 'Laos' prior to 1945. Particularly the
functionaries among them, who might be posted from place to place in all five subsections of
the colony, could well imagine Indochina as the wide stage on which they would continue to
perform.
Such imagining was much less easy for Lao and Khmer functionaries, although there was no
formal or legal prohibition on fully-Indochinese careers for them. Even the more ambitious
youngsters coming from the c.326,000 (1937) Khmer Krom community in eastern Indochina
(representing perhaps 10 per cent of the entire Khmer-speaking population) found that in
practice they had very limited career prospects outside 'Cambodge'. Thus Khmer and Lao
might sit alongside Vietnamese in French-language secondary and tertiary schools in Saigon
and Hanoi, but they were unlikely to go on to share administrative offices there. Like
youngsters from Cotonou and Abidjan in Dakar, they were destined to go back, on
graduation, to the 'homes' colonialism had demarcated for them. To put it another way, if
their educational pilgrimages were directed towards Hanoi, their administrative journeys
ended in Phnom Penh and Vientiane.
Out of these contradictions emerged those Khmer-speaking students who subsequently came
to be remembered as the first Cambodian nationalists. The man who can reasonably be
regarded as the 'father' of Khmer nationalism, Son Ngoc Thanh, was, as his Vietnamized
name suggests, a Khmer Krom who was educated in Saigon and for a while held a minor
judicial post in that city. But in the mid-1930s he abandoned the Paris of the Mekong Delta to
seek a more promising future in its Blois. Prince Sisowath Youtevong attended secondary
school in Saigon before leaving for France for further study. When he returned to Phnom
Penh fifteen years later, after World War II, he helped to found the (Khmer) Democratic
Party and served as Prime Minister in 1946-1947. His Defence Minister, Sonn Voeunnsai,
undertook virtually the same journeys. Huy Kanthoul, Democratic Prime Minister in 1951-
1952, had graduated from an ecole normale in Hanoi in 1931, and was then returned to
Phnom Penh, where he eventually joined the Lycee Sisowath's teaching staff.32 Perhaps most
exemplary of all is the [131] figure of Ieu Koeus, first of a melancholy line of assassinated
Khmer political leaders.33 Born in the province of Battambang in 1905 - when it was still
ruled from Bangkok-he attended a local 'reformed pagoda school' before entering an
'Indochinese' elementary school in Battambang town. In 1921, he proceeded to the College
Sisowath in the Protectorate's capital, and then to a college de commerce in Hanoi, from
which he graduated in 1927 at the top of his French-reading class. Hoping to study chemistry
in Bordeaux, he took and passed the scholarship examination. But the colonial state blocked
his way abroad. He returned to his native Battambang, where he ran a pharmacy, continuing
to do so even after Bangkok regained the province in 1941. After the Japanese collapse in
August 1945, he reappeared in 'Cambodge' as a Democratic parliamentarian. It is notable that
he was in his way a lineal descendent of the illustrious philologists of an earlier Europe,
insofar as he designed a typewriter keyboard for the Khmer script and published a weighty
two-volume Pheasa Khmer [The Khmer Language], or as the misleading title-page of the
1967 edition has it, La Langue Cambodgienne (Un Essai d'etude raisonn'e).34 But this text
made its first appearance - volume 1 only - in 1947, when its author was Chairman of the
Constituent Assembly in Phnom Penh, not in 1937, when he was vegetating in Battambang,
when as yet no Khmer-speaking lyceens had been produced by the Lycee Sisowath, and when
Indochina still had an ephemeral reality. By 1947, Khmer-speakers - at least those from
'Cambodge' - were no longer attending classes in Saigon or Hanoi. A new generation was
coming on the scene for whom 'Indochine' was history and 'Vietnam' now a real and foreign
country.
It is true that brutal invasions and occupations during the nineteenth century, ordered by the
Nguyen dynasts in Hu6, left bitter folk-memories among the Khmer, including those in that
'Cochin China' fated to become part of Vietnam. But comparable bitternesses [132] existed in
the Netherlands Indies: Sundanese against Javanese; Batak against Minangkabau; Sasak
against Balinese; Toraja against Buginese; Javanese against Ambonese, and so on. The socalled
'federalist policy' pursued between 1945 and 1948 by the formidable Lieutenant
Governor-General Hubertus van Mook to outflank the infant Indonesian Republic attempted
precisely to exploit such bitternesses.35 But in spite of a spate of ethnic rebellions in almost all
parts of independent Indonesia between 1950 and 1964, 'Indonesia' survived. In part it
survived because Batavia remained the educational apex to the end, but also because colonial
administrative policy did not rusticate educated Sundanese to the 'Sundalands,' or Batak to
their place of origin in the highlands of North Sumatra. Virtually all the major ethnolinguistic
groups were, by the end of the colonial period, accustomed to the idea that there was an
archipelagic stage on which they had parts to play. Thus, only one of the rebellions of 1950-
64 had separatist ambitions; all the rest were competitive within a single Indonesian political
system.36
In addition, one can not ignore the curious accident that by the 1920s an 'Indonesian
language'had come into self-conscious existence. How this accident came about is so
instructive that it seems worth a brief digression. Earlier, mention was made of the fact that
only to a limited and late extent were the Indies ruled through Dutch. How could it not be so,
when the Dutch had begun their local conquests in the early seventeenth century, while
Dutch-language instruction for inlanders was not seriously undertaken until the early
twentieth? What happened instead was that by a slow, largely unplanned process, a strange
language-of-state evolved on the basis of an ancient inter-insular lingua franca.37 Called
dienstmaleisch (perhaps 'service-Malay' [133] or 'administrative-Malay'), it belonged
typologically with 'Ottoman' and that 'fiscal German' which emerged from the polyglot
barracks of the Habsburg empire.38 By the early nineteenth century it was solidly in place
inside officialdom. When print-capitalism arrived on the scene in a sizeable way after midcentury,
the language moved out into the marketplace and the media. Used at first mainly by
Chinese and Eurasian newspapermen and printers, it was picked up by inlanders at the
century's close. Quickly the dienst branch of its family tree was forgotten and replaced by a
putative ancestor in the Riau Islands (of which the most important had - perhaps fortunately
-since 1819 become British Singapore). By 1928, shaped by two generations of urban writers
and readers, it was ready to be adopted by Young Indonesia as the national(-ist) language
bahasa Indonesia. Since then, it has never looked back.
Yet, in the end, the Indonesian case, interesting as it is, should not mislead us into thinking
that, if Holland had been a bigger power,39 and had arrived in 1850 rather than 1600, the
national language could not just as well have been Dutch. Nothing suggests that Ghanaian
nationalism is any less real than Indonesian simply because its national language is English
rather than Ashanti. It is always a mistake to treat languages in the way that certain nationalist
ideologues treat them-as emblems of nation-ness, like flags, costumes, folk-dances, and the
rest. Much the most important thing about language is its capacity for generating imagined
communities, building in effect particular solidarities. After all, imperial languages are still
vernaculars, [134] and thus particular vernaculars among many. If radical Mozambique
speaks Portuguese, the significance of this is that Portuguese is the medium through which
Mozambique is imagined (and at the same time limits its stretch into Tanzania and Zambia).
Seen from this perspective the use of Portuguese in Mozambique (or English in India) is
basically no different than the use of English in Australia or Portuguese in Brazil. Language
is not an instrument of exclusion: in principle, anyone can learn any language. On the
contrary, it is fundamentally inclusive, limited only by the fatality of Babel: no one lives long
enough to learn all languages. Print-language is what invents nationalism, not a particular
language per se.40 The only question-mark standing over languages like Portuguese in
Mozambique and English in India is whether the administrative and educational systems,
particularly the latter, can generate a politically sufficient diffusion of bilingualism. Thirty
years ago, almost no Indonesian spoke bahasa Indonesia as his or her mother-tongue;
virtually everyone had their own 'ethnic' language and some, especially people in the
nationalist movement, bahasa Indonesia/dienst-maleisch as well. Today there are perhaps
millions of young Indonesians, from dozens of ethnolinguistic backgrounds, who speak
Indonesian as their mother-tongue.
It is not clear yet whether thirty years from now there will be a generation of Mozambiquians
who speak only Mozambique-Portuguese. But, in this late twentieth century, it is not
necessarily the case that the emergence of such a generation is a sine qua non for [135]
Mozambiquian national solidarity. In the first place, advances in communications technology,
especially radio and television, give print allies unavailable a century ago. Multilingual
broadcasting can conjure up the imagined community to illiterates and populations with
different mother-tongues. (Here there are resemblances to the conjuring up of mediaeval
Christendom through visual representations and bilingual literati.) In the second place,
twentieth-century nationalisms have, as I have been arguing, a profoundly modular character.
They can, and do, draw on more than a century and a half of human experience and three
earlier models of nationalism. Nationalist leaders are thus in a position consciously to deploy
civil and military educational systems modelled on official nationalism's; elections, party
organizations, and cultural celebrations modelled on the popular nationalisms of ninteenthcentury
Europe; and the citizen-republican idea brought into the world by the Americas.
Above all, the very idea of'nation' is now nestled firmly in virtually all print-languages; and
nation-ness is virtually inseparable from political consciousness.
In a world in which the national state is the overwhelming norm, all of this means that nations
can now be imagined without linguistic communality - not in the naive spirit of nosotros los
Americanos, but out of a general awareness of what modern history has demonstrated to be
possible.41 It seems fitting, in this context, to conclude this chapter by returning to Europe and
considering briefly that nation whose linguistic diversity has so often been used as a cudgel to
club proponents of language-based theories of nationalism.
In 1891, amidst novel jubilees marking the 600th anniversary of the Confederacy of Schwyz,
Obwalden, and Nidwalden, the Swiss state 'decided on' 1291 as the date of the 'founding' of
Switzerland.42 Such a decision, waiting 600 years to be made, has its diverting aspects, and
suggests already that modernity rather than antiquity characterizes [136] Swiss nationalism.
Indeed, Hughes goes so far as to argue that the 1891 jubilees mark the birth of this
nationalism, commenting that 'in the first half of the nineteenth century... nationhood sat
rather lightly on the shoulders of the cultivated middle classes: Mme de Stael [1766-1817],
Fuseli [1741-1825], Angelica Kauffmann [1741-1807], Sismondi [1773-1842], Benjamin
Constant [1767-1830], are they all Swiss?'43 If the implied answer is 'hardly,' its significance
derives from the fact that, all over the Europe surrounding Switzerland, the first half of the
nineteenth century saw the burgeoning of vernacular nationalist movements in which
'cultivated middle classes' (as it were, philologists + capitalists) played central parts. Why
then did nationalism come so late to Switzerland, and what consequences did that lateness
have for its ultimate shaping (in particular, its contemporary multiplicity of 'national
languages')?
Part of the answer lies in the youth of the Swiss state, which, Hughes drily observes, is
difficult to trace back beyond 1813-15 'without the aid of some prevarication.'44 He reminds
us that the first real Swiss citizenship, the introduction of direct (male) suffrage, and the
ending of'internal' tolls and customs areas were achievements of the Helvetic Republic
forcibly brought into being by the French occupation of 1798. Only in 1803 did the state
include significant numbers of Italian-speakers, with the acquisition of Ticino. Only in 1815
did it gain the populous French-speaking areas of Valais, Geneva, and Neuchatel from a
vengefully anti-French Holy Alliance-in exchange for neutrality and a highly conservative
constitution.45 In effect, today's multilingual Switzerland is a product of the early nineteenth
century.46
A second factor was the country's backwardness (which, combined [137] with its forbidding
topography and lack of exploitable resources, helped to keep it from absorption by more
powerful neighbours). Today it may be difficult to remember that until World War II
Switzerland was a poor country, with a standard of living half that of England's, and an
overwhelmingly rural country. In 1850, barely 6 per cent of the population lived in
minimally urban areas, and as late as 1920 the figure had risen only to 27.6 per cent.47
Throughout the nineteenth century, then, the bulk of the population was an immobile (except
for the age-old export of hardy youths as mercenaries and Papal Guards) peasantry. The
country's backwardness was not merely economic, it was also political and cultural. 'Old
Switzerland,' the area of which did not change between 1515 and 1803, and most of whose
inhabitants spoke one or other of numerous German patois, was ruled by a loose coalition of
cantonal aristocratic oligarchies. 'The secret of the long duration of the Confederacy was its
double nature. Against outside enemies it produced a sufficient unity of peoples. Against
internal rebellion, it produced a sufficient unity of oligarchies. If peasants rebelled, as they
did three times or so in every century, then differences would be put aside and the
governments of other cantons would lend their assistance, mediating often, but not always, in
favour of their fellow-ruler.'48 Except for the absence of monarchical institutions, the picture
is not much different from that of the innumerable petty principalities within the Holy Roman
Empire, of which Liechtenstein, on Switzerland's eastern border, is a last odd relic.49
It is instructive that as late as 1848, almost two generations after the Swiss state came into
being, ancient religious cleavages were much more politically salient than linguistic ones.
Remarkably enough, in territories unalterably-denoted Catholic Protestantism was unlawful,
and in those so-denoted Protestant Catholicism was [138] illegal; and these laws were strictly
enforced. (Language was a matter of personal choice and convenience). Only after 1848, in
the backwash of Europe-wide revolutionary upheavals and the general spread of
vernacularizing national movements, did language take religion's place, and the country
become segmented into unalterably-denoted linguistic zones. (Religion now became a matter
of personal choice).50
Finally, the persistence - in such a small country - of a large variety of sometimes mutuallyunintelligible
German idiolects suggests the late arrival of print-capitalism and standardized
modern education to much of Swiss peasant society. Thus Hochsprache (print-German) has
had, until rather recently, the language-of-state status of drarisch deutsch and dienstmaleisch.
Furthermore, Hughes remarks that today 'higher' officials are expected to have a working
knowledge of two federal languages, implying that the same competence is not expected of
their subordinates. Indirectly, a similar point is made by the Federal Directive of 1950 which
insists that 'Educated German Swiss are certainly able to work in French, as are educated
Italian Swiss.'51 We have, in effect, a situation which at bottom is not too different from
Mozambique's-a bilingual political class ensconced over a variety of monolingual
populations, with only this dissimilarity: the 'second language' is that of a powerful neighbour
rather than of a former colonial ruler.
Nonetheless, in view of the fact that in 1910 the maternal language of almost 73 per cent of
the population was German, 22 per cent French, 4 per cent Italian, and 1 per cent Romansch
(these proportions have scarcely varied over the intervening decades), it is perhaps surprising
that in the second half of the nineteenth century -era of official nationalisms -
Germanification was not attempted. Certainly up to 1914 strong pro-German sympathies
existed. Between Germany and German Switzerland borders were porous in the extreme.
Trade and investment, as well as aristocrats and professionals, moved back and forth quite
freely. But Switzerland also abutted on two other major European powers, France and Italy,
and the [139] political risks of Germanizing were plain. Legal parity between German,
French, and Italian was thus the obverse side of the coin of Swiss neutrality.52
All of the preceding evidence indicates that Swiss nationalism is best understood as part of
the 'last wave'. If Hughes is right in dating its birth to 1891, it is not much more than a decade
older than Burmese or Indonesian nationalism. In other words, it arose in that period of world
history in which the nation was becoming an international norm, and in which it was possible
to 'model' nation-ness in a much more complex way than hitherto. If the conservative
political, and backward socio-economic, structure of Switzerland 'delayed' the rise of
nationalism,53 the fact that its pre-modern political institutions were non-dynastic and nonmonarchical
helped to prevent the excesses of official nationalism (contrast the case of Siam
discussed in Chapter 6). Finally, as in the case of the Southeast Asian examples, the
appearance of Swiss nationalism on the eve of the communications revolution of the
twentieth century made it possible and practical to 'represent' the imagined community in
ways that did not require linguistic uniformity.
In conclusion, it may be worth restating the general argument of this chapter. The 'last wave'
of nationalisms, most of them in the colonial territories of Asia and Africa, was in its origins
a response to the new-style global imperialism made possible by the achievements of
industrial capitalism. As Marx put it in his inimitable way: 'The need of a constantly
expanding market for its products chases the bourgeoisie over the whole face of the globe.'54
But capitalism had also, not least by its dissemination of print, helped to create popular,
vernacular-based nationalisms in Europe, which to different degrees undermined the age-old
dynastic principle, and egged into self- [140] naturalization every dynasty positioned to do so.
Official nationalism-weld of the new national and old dynastic principles (the British Empire)
- led in turn to what, for convenience, one can call 'Russifica-tion' in the extra-European
colonies. This ideological tendency meshed neatly with practical exigencies. The latenineteenth-
century empires were too large and too far-flung to be ruled by a handful of
nationals. Moreover, in tandem with capitalism the state was rapidly multiplying its
functions, in both the metropoles and the colonies. Combined, these forces generated
'Russifying' school-systems intended in part to produce the required subordinate cadres for
state and corporate bureaucracies. These school-systems, centralized and standardized,
created quite new pilgrimages which typically had their Romes in the various colonial
capitals, for the nations hidden at the core of the empires would permit no more inward
ascension. Usually, but by no means always, these educational pilgrimages were paralleled,
or replicated, in the administrative sphere. The interlock between particular educational and
administrative pilgrimages provided the territorial base for new 'imagined communities' in
which natives could come to see themselves as 'nationals'. The expansion of the colonial state
which, so to speak, invited 'natives' into schools and offices, and of colonial capitalism which,
as it were, excluded them from boardrooms, meant that to an unprecedented extent the key
early spokesmen for colonial nationalism were lonely, bilingual intelligentsias unattached to
sturdy local bourgeoisies.
As bilingual intelligentsias, however, and above all as early-twentieth-century intelligentsias,
they had access, inside the classroom and outside, to models of nation, nation-ness, and
nationalism distilled from the turbulent, chaotic experiences of more than a century of
American and European history. These models, in turn, helped to give shape to a thousand
inchoate dreams. In varying combinations, the lessons of Creole, vernacular and official
nationalism were copied, adapted, and improved upon. Finally, as with increasing speed
capitalism transformed the means of physical and intellectual communication, the
intelligentsias found ways to bypass print in propagating the imagined community, not
merely to illiterate masses, but even to literate masses reading different languages.
1. Not only, of course by functionaries, though they were the main group. Consider, for example, the geography
ofNoli Me Tangere (and many other nationalist novels). Though some of the most important characters in Rizal's
text are Spanish, and some of the Filipino characters have been to Spain (off the novel's stage), the
circumambience of travel by any of the characters is confined to what, eleven years after its publication and two
years after its author's execution, would become the Republic of the Philippines.
2. To give only one example: by 1928, there were almost 250,000 indigenes on the payroll of the Netherlands
East Indies, and these formed 90% of all state functionaries. (Symptomatically, the widely discrepant salaries
and pensions of Dutch and native officials, when combined, ate up 50% of state expenditures!). See Amry
Vandenbosch, The Dutch East Indies, pp. 171-73. Yet Dutchmen were proportionately nine times as thick on the
bureaucratic ground as were Englishmen in British (non-'native state') India.
3. Even in the ultra-conservative Netherlands Indies, the number of natives receiving a primary Western-style
education shot up from an average of 2,987 in the years 1900-04 to 74,697 in 1928; while those receiving a
Western-style secondary education increased in the same span of time from 25 to 6,468. Kahin, Nationalism, p.
31.
4. To borrow from Anthony Barnett, it also 'allowed the intellectuals to say to their fellow-speakers [of the
indigenous vernaculars] that "we" can be like "them"'.
5. It appeared originally in De Expres on July 13, 1913, but was quickly translated into 'Indonesian' and
published in the native press. Suwardi was then 24 years old. An unusually well-educated and progressive
aristocrat, he had in 1912 joined with a Javanese commoner, Dr. Tjipto Mangoenkoesoemo, and a Eurasian,
Eduard Douwes Dekker, to form the Indische Partij, the colony's first political party. For a brief, but useful,
study of Suwardi, see Savitri Scherer, 'Harmony and Dissonance: Early Nationalist Thought in Java', chapter 2.
Her Appendix I gives an English translation of the famous article, from which this passage is drawn.
6. Notice the educational linkage here between 'imagined' and 'imaginary' communities.
7. The celebrations of 1913 were agreeably emblematic of official nationalism in another sense. The 'national
liberation' commemorated was in fact the restoration of the House of Orange by the victorious armies of the
Holy Alliance (not the establishment of the Batavian Republic in 1795); and half the liberated nation soon
seceded to form the Kingdom of Belgium in 1830. But the 'national liberation' gloss was certainly what Suwardi
imbibed in his colonial classroom.
8. 'Marxism and the National Question,' p. 41.
9. Our focus here will be on civilian schools. But their military counterparts were often important too. The
professionally officered standing army pioneered by Prussia early in the nineteenth century has required an
educational pyramid in some ways more elaborate, if not more specialized, than its civilian analogue. Young
officers ('Turks') produced by new military academies have often played significant roles in the development of
nationalism. Emblematic is the case of Major Chukuma Nzeogwu, who masterminded the January 15,1966 coup
in Nigeria. A Christian Ibo, he was among the first group of young Nigerians sent for training to Sandhurst to
make possible the transformation of a white-officered colonial mercenary force into a national army, on
Nigeria's attainment of independence in 1960. (If he attended Sandhurst with the future Brigadier Afrifa, who,
also in 1966, was to overthrow his government, each native was destined to return to his own imperial habitat).
It is striking evidence of the power of the Prussian model that he was able to lead Muslim Hausa troops in
assassinating the Sardauna of Sokoto and other Muslim Hausa aristocrats, and, consequently, destroy the
Muslim-Hausa-dominated government of Abubakar Tafawa Balewa, It is no less striking a sign of colonialschool-
generated nationalism that over Radio Kaduna he assured his countrymen that 'you will no more be
ashamed to say that you are Nigerian.' (Quotation taken from Anthony H.M. Kirk-Greene, Crisis and Conflict in
Nigeria: A Documentary Source Book, p. 126.) Yet nationalism was thinly enough then spread in Nigeria for
Nzeogwu's nationalist coup to be quickly interpreted as an Ibo plot; hence the military mutinies of July, the anti-
Ibo pogroms of September and October, and Biafra's secession in May 1967. (See Robin Luckham's superb The
Nigerian Military, passim.)
10. The idea of a student being 'too old' to be in class X or Y, unthinkable in a traditional Muslim school, was an
unselfconscious axiom of the colonial Western-style school.
11. Ultimately, of course, the apices were The Hague, Amsterdam, and Leiden; but those who could seriously
dream of studying there were a tiny handful.
12. Being secular, twentieth-century schools they were usually co-educational, though with boys the
preponderant majority. Hence love-affairs, and quite often marriages, 'off the school-bench,' which crossed all
traditional lines.
13. Sukarno never saw the West Irian for which he fought so hard till he was over 60. Here, as in the
schoolroom maps, we see fiction seeping into reality - cf. Noli and El Periquillo Samiento.
14. Compare, by contrast, 'half-breeds' or 'niggers,' who, beginning at Calais, could crop up anywhere on the
planet outside the United Kingdom.
15. On the origins and development of this famous school, see Abdou Moumouni, L'EJucation en Afrique, pp.
41-49; on its political significance, Ruth Schachter Morgenthau, Political Parties in French-Speaking West
Africa, pp. 12-14,18-21. Originally an untitled ecole normale located in Saint-Louis, it was moved to Goree, just
outside Dakar, in 1913. Subsequently it was named after William Merlaud-Ponty, the fourth governor-general
(1908-15) of French West Africa. Serge Thion informs me that the name William (as opposed to Guillaume) has
long been in vogue in the area around Bordeaux. He is surely right in attributing this popularity to the historic
ties with England created by the wine trade; but it seems just possible that it goes back to the era when Bordeaux
(Guyenne) was still a solid part of the realm ruled from London.
16. There seems to have been nothing similar in British West Africa, whether because the British colonies were
non-contiguous, or because London was wealthy and liberal enough to start secondary schools almost
simultaneously in the major territories, or because of the localism of rival Protestant missionary organizations.
Achimota School, a secondary school founded by the colonial state in Accra in 1927, quickly became the main
peak of a Gold Coast-specific educational pyramid, and after independence it was where the children of cabinet
ministers began learning how to succeed their fathers. A rival peak, Mfantsipim Secondary School, had the
advantage of seniority (it was founded in 1876), but the weaknesses of locale (Cape Coast) and semi-detachment
from the state (it was in denominational hands till well after independence). I owe this information to Mohamed
Chambas.
17. It led, inter alia, to a one-generation (1930-1951?) Indochinese Communist Party in which, for a time,
youngsters whose mother tongues might be Vietnamese, Khmer, or Lao participated. Today, the formation of
this party is sometimes viewed merely as an expression of 'age-old Vietnamese expansionism.' In fact, it was
sired by the Comintern out of the educational (and to a lesser extent administrative) system of French Indochina.
18. This policy is ably and thoroughly discussed in Gail Paradise Kelly, 'Franco-Vietnamese Schools, 1918 to
1938'. Unluckily, the author concentrates exclusively on the Vietnamese-speaking population of Indochina.
19. I use this perhaps clumsy terminology to emphasize the colonial origins of these entities. 'Laos' was
assembled out of a cluster of rival principalities, leaving more than half of the Lao-speaking population in Siam.
The boundaries of 'Cambodge' conformed neither to any particular historical stretch of the precolonial realm,
nor to the distribution of the Khmer-speaking peoples. Some hundreds of thousands of such people ended up
trapped in 'Cochin China,' producing in time that distinct community known as the Khmer Krom (down-river
Khmer).
20. They pursued this aim by establishing in the 1930s an Ecole Superieure de Pali in Phnom Penh, an
ecclesiastical college attended by both Khmer- and Lao-speaking monks. The attempt to turn Buddhist eyes
away from Bangkok seems not to have been wholly successful. In 1942 (shortly after Siam regained control of
much of northwestern 'Cambodge' with Japanese assistance), the French arrested a venerable professor of the
Ecole for possession and distribution of'subversive' Thai educational materials. (Most likely, these materials
were some of the strongly nationalist school-texts produced by the vociferously anti-French regime of Field-
Marshal Plaek Phibunsongkhram (1938-1944).
21. David G. Marr, Vietnamese Tradition on Trial, 1920-1945, p. 146. No less alarming were smuggled Chinese
translations of such troubling French authors as Rousseau. (Kelly, 'Franco-Vietnamese Schools, p. 19).
22. In its final form, this script is usually attributed to the gifted lexicographer Alexandre de Rhodes, who in
1651 published his remarkable Dictionarium annamiticum, lusitanum et latinum.
23. '[Most] French colonial officials of the late nineteenth century... were convinced that to achieve permanent
colonial success required the harsh curtailment of Chinese influences, including the writing system.
Missionaries often saw the Confucian literati as the main obstacle to the general Catholic conversion of
Vietnam. Hence, in their view, to eliminate the Chinese language was simultaneously to isolate Vietnam from
its heritage and to neutralize the traditional elite.' (Marr, Vietnamese Tradition, p. 145). Kelly quotes one
colonial writer thus: 'in effect, the teaching of quoc ngu alone... will have the result of communicating to
Vietnamese only the French writing, literature, and philosophy which we wish them [to be exposed to]. That is
those [works] which we judge useful to them and easily assimilable: only the texts which we transcribe into
quoc ngu.' 'Franco-Vietnamese Schools', p. 22.
24. See Ibid., pp. 14-15. For a wider, lower stratum of the Indochinese population Governor-General Albert
Sarraut (author of the 1917 Code of Public Instruction) urged: 'a simple education, reduced to essentials,
permitting the child to learn all that will be useful to him to know in his humble career of farmer or artisan to
ameliorate the natural and social conditions of his existence.' Ibid., p. 17.
25. In 1937, a total of 631 students were enrolled, 580 of them in the faculties of law and medicine. Ibid., p. 79;
see also pp. 69-79, for the bizarre history of this institution, founded in 1906, closed in 1908, reopened in 1918,
and never, till the late 1930s, much more than a glorified vocational college.
26. As I shall be concentrating on Khmers and Vietnamese below, this may be the place to make a brief
reference to some prominent Lao. The present Prime Minister of Laos, Kaysone Phoumvihan attended the
University of Hanoi's medical faculty in the late 1930s. The head of state, Prince Souphanouvong, graduated
from Hanoi's Lycee Albert Sarraut before obtaining an engineering degree in metropolitan France. His elder
brother, Prince Phetsarath Ratanavongsa, who headed the short-lived Lao Issara (Free Lao) anticolonial
government in Vientiane from October 1945 to April 1946, had as a youth been graduated from Saigon's Lycee
Chasseloup-Laubat. Prior to World War II, the highest educational institution in 'Laos' was the small College
[i.e. junior high school] Pavie in Vientiane. See JosephJ. Zasloff, Pathet Lao, pp. 104-105; and '3349'
[pseudonym of Phetsarath Ratanavongsa], Iron Man of Laos, pp. 12 and 46. It is revealing, I think, that in his
account of his later schooldays in Paris, Phetsarath regularly and unselfconsciously speaks of his identifiably
Lao, Khmer, and Vietnamese classmates as 'the Indochinese students.' See, e.g., ibid., pp. 14-15.
27. Thus in the previously 'integrated' lyc'ees Chasseloup-Laubat and Albert Sarraut, sub-standard 'native
sections' were established in 1917-1918. These 'native sections' eventually turned respectively into the Lycee
Petrus Ky and the Lycee du Protectorat. (Ibid., pp. 60-63). Nonetheless, a minority of privileged indigenes
continued to attend the 'real French' lyc'ees (the adolescent Norodom Sihanouk graced Chasseloup-Laubat),
while a minority of 'French' (mainly Eurasians and natives with French legal status) attended Petrus Ky and its
sister institution in Hanoi.
28. Marr notes that in the 1920s 'even the most optimistic member of the intelligentsia [committed to quoc ngS]
could not have guessed that only two decades later, citizens of a Democratic Republic of Vietnam would be able
to conduct all important affairs - political,,military, economic, scientific and academic - in spoken Vietnamese
linked to the quoc ngu writing system.' Vietnamese Tradition, p. 150. It was also a disagreeable surprise to the
French.
29. It is instructive that one of the first issues raised by the early Khmer nationalists of the late 1930s was the
'menace'of a so-called'quoc ngu-ization'of the Khmer script by the colonial authorities.
30. The pattern was not immediately followed in Vientiane. Toye reports that in the course of the 1930s only 52
Lao were graduated from the College [he wrongly terms it Lycee] Pavie, as opposed to 96 Vietnamese. Laos, p.
45.
31. It is possible that this influx paralleled the institution of the Franco-Vietnamese school system, in that it
deflected Vietnamese from competing with French nationals in the more advanced, eastern parts of Indochina.
In 1937, there were 39,000 Europeans living in 'Cochin China,' 'Annam' and 'Tonkin,' and only 3,100 in
'Cambodge' and 'Laos' combined. Marr, Vietnamese Tradition, p. 23.

36. The exception was the abortive Republic of the South Moluccas. Christianized Ambonese had long been
heavily recruited for the repressive colonial army. Many fought under van Mook against the new-born
revolutionary Indonesian Republic; after Holland's recognition of Indonesian independence in 1950, they had
some reason to expect an unpleasant future.
37. See the valuable account in John Hoffman, 'A Foreign Investment: Indies Malay to 1902,' Indonesia, 27
(April 1979), pp. 65-92.
38. The military 'constituted something like an anal tonal caste, the members of which lived even in their
private lives ordinarly distinct from their national environments and spoke very often a special language, the socalled
ararisch deutsch ("fiscal German"), as it was ironically named by the representatives of the literary
German, meaning by it a strange linguistic mixture which does not take the rules of grammar very
seriously.'Jaszi, The Dissolution, p. 144. Author's emphases.
39. Not merely in the obvious sense. Because, in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, Holland had, for all
intents and purposes, only one colony, and a huge, profitable one at that, it was quite practical to train its
functionaries in a (single) non-European diensttaal. Over time, special schools and faculties grew up in the
metropole to prepare future functionaries linguistically. For multi-continental empires like the British, no single
locally-based diensttaal would have sufficed.
40. Marr's account of language-development in eastern Indochina is very revealing on this point. He notes that
as late as c. 1910 'most educated Vietnamese assumed that Chinese or French, or both, were essential modes of
"higher" communication.' (Vietnamese Tradition, p. 137). After 1920, however, and partly as a result of state
promotion of the phonetic quoc tigu script, things changed quickly. By then 'the belief was growing that spoken
Vietnamese was an important and perhaps [sic] essential component of national identity. Even intellectuals more
at home in French than in their mother tongue came to appreciate the significance of the fact that at least 85% of
their fellow-countrymen spoke the same language.' (p. 138) They were by then fully aware of the role of mass
literacy in advancing the nation-states of Europe and Japan. Yet Marr also shows that for a long time there was
no clear correlation between language-preference and political stance: 'Upholding the Vietnamese mother
tongue was not inherently patriotic, any more than promoting the French language was inherently
collaborationist.' (p. 150).
41. I say 'can' because there are obviously plenty of cases where the possibility has been, and is being, rejected.
In such cases, for example Old Pakistan, the explanation is not ethno-cultural pluralism, but barred pilgrimages.

46. We might note in passing that Mme. de Stael barely survived long enough to see its birth. Besides, her
family, like that of Sismondi, came from Geneva, which was an independent statelet outside 'Switzerland' until
1815. Small wonder that Swiss nationhood rested 'rather lightly' on their shoulders.

8. Patriotism and Racism
[141] In the preceding chapters I have tried to delineate the processes by which the nation
came to be imagined, and, once imagined, modelled, adapted and transformed. Such an
analysis has necessarily been concerned primarily with social change and different forms of
consciousness. But it is doubtful whether either social change or transformed
consciousnesses, in themselves, do much to explain the attachment that peoples feel for the
inventions of their imaginations - or, to revive a question raised at the beginning of this textwhy
people are ready to die for these inventions.
In an age when it is so common for progressive, cosmopolitan intellectuals (particularly in
Europe?) to insist on the near-pathological character of nationalism, its roots in fear and
hatred of the Other, and its affinities with racism,1 it is useful to remind ourselves that nations
inspire love, and often profoundly self-sacrificing love. The cultural products of nationalismpoetry,
prose fiction, music, plastic arts - show this love very clearly in thousands of different
forms and styles. On the other hand, how truly rare it is to find [142] analogous nationalist
products expressing fear and loathing.2 Even in the case of colonized peoples, who have
every reason to feel hatred for their imperialist rulers, it is astonishing how insignificant the
element of hatred is in these expression of national feeling. Here, for example, are the first
and last stanzas of Último Adiós, the famous poem written by Rizal as he awaited execution
at the hands of Spanish imperialism:3
1. Adiós, Patria adorada, región del sol querida,
Perla del Mar de Oriente, nuestro perdido edén,
A darte voy, alegre, la triste mustia vida;
Y fuera más brillante, más fresca, más florida,
También por ti la diera, la diera por tu bien...
12. Entonces nada importa me pongas en olvido:
Tu atmósfera, tu espacio, tus valles cruzaré;
Vibrante y limpia nota seré par tu oído;
Aroma, luz, colores, rumor, canto, gemido,
Constante repitiendo la esencia de mi fe.
13. Mi Patria idolatrada, dolor de mis dolores,
Querida Filipinas, oye el postrer adiós.
Ahí, te dejo todo: mis padres, mis amores.
Voy donde no hay esclavos, verdugos ni opresores;
Donde la fe no mata, donde el que reina es Dios.
14. Adiós, padres y hermanos, trozos del alma mía,
Amigos de la infancia, en el perdido hogar;
Dad gracias, que descanso del fatigoso día;
Adiós, dulce extranjera, mi amiga, mi alegría;
Adiós, queridos séres. Morir es descansar.
[143] Notice not only that the nationality of the 'tyrants' goes unmentioned, but that Rizal's
passionate patriotism is expressed superbly in 'their' language.4
Something of the nature of this political love can be deciphered from the ways in which
languages describe its object: either in the vocabulary of kinship (motherland, Vaterland,
patria) or that of home (heimat or tanah air [earth and water, the phrase for the Indonesians'
native archipelago]). Both idioms denote something to which one is naturally tied. As we
have seen earlier, in everything 'natural' there is always something unchosen. In this way,
nation-ness is assimilated to skin-colour, gender, parentage and birth-era - all those things one
can not help. And in these 'natural ties' one senses what one might call 'the beauty of
gemeinschaft'. To put it another way, precisely because such ties are not chosen, they have
about them a halo of disinterestedness.
While it is true that in the past two decades the idea of the family- [144] as-articulated-powerstructure
has been much written about, such a conception is certainly foreign to the
overwhelming bulk of mankind. Rather, the family has traditionally been conceived as the
domain of disinterested love and solidarity. So too, if historians, diplomats, politicians, and
social scientists are quite at ease with the idea of'national interest," for most ordinary people
of whatever class the whole point of the nation is that it is interestless. Just for that reason, it
can ask for sacrifices.
As noted earlier, the great wars of this century are extraordinary not so much in the
unprecedented scale on which they permitted people to kill, as in the colossal numbers
persuaded to lay down their lives. Is it not certain that the numbers of those killed vastly
exceeded those who killed? The idea of the ultimate sacrifice comes only with an idea of
purity, through fatality.
Dying for one's country, which usually one does not choose, assumes a moral grandeur which
dying for the Labour Party, the American Medical Association, or perhaps even Amnesty
International can not rival, for these are all bodies one can join or leave at easy will. Dying
for the revolution also draws its grandeur from the degree to which it is felt to be something
fundamentally pure. (If people imagined the proletariat merely as a group in hot pursuit of
refrigerators, holidays, or power, how far would they, including members of the proletariat,
be willing to die for it?)5 Ironically enough, it may be that to the extent that Marxist
interpretations of history are felt (rather than intellected) as representations of ineluctable
necessity, they also acquire an aura of purity and disinterestedness.
Here we may usefully return once more to language. First, one notes the primordialness of
languages, even those known to be modern. No one can give the date for the birth of any
language. Each looms up imperceptibly out of a horizonless past. (Insofar as homo sapiens is
homo dicens, it can seem difficult to imagine an origin of [145] language newer than the
species itself.) Languages thus appear rooted beyond almost anything else in contemporary
societies. At the same time, nothing connects us affectively to the dead more than language.
If English-speakers hear the words 'Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust' - created
almost four-and-a-half centuries ago - they get a ghostly intimation of simultaneity across
homogeneous, empty time. The weight of the words derives only in part from their solemn
meaning; it comes also from an as-it-were ancestral 'Englishness'.
Second, there is a special kind of contemporaneous community which language alone
suggests-above all in the form of poetry and songs. Take national anthems, for example, sung
on national holidays. No matter how banal the words and mediocre the tunes, there is in this
singing an experience of simultaneity. At precisely such moments, people wholly unknown to
each other utter the same verses to the same melody. The image: unisonance.6 Singing the
Marseillaise, Waltzing Matilda, and Indonesia Raya provide occasions for unisonality, for the
echoed physical realization of the imagined community. (So does listening to [and maybe
silently chiming in with] the recitation of ceremonial poetry, such as sections of The Book of
Common Prayer.) How selfless this unisonance feels! If we are aware that others are singing
these songs precisely when and as we are, we have no idea who they may be, or even where,
out of earshot, they are singing. Nothing connects us all but imagined sound.
Yet such choruses are joinable in time. If I am a Lett, my daughter may be an Australian. The
son of an Italian immigrant to New York will find ancestors in the Pilgrim Fathers. If
nationalness has about it an aura of fatality, it is nonetheless a fatality embedded in history.
Here San Martin's edict baptizing Quechua-speaking Indians as 'Peruvians'-a movement that
has affinities with religious conversion - is exemplary. For it shows that from the start the
nation was conceived in language, not in blood, and that one could be 'invited into' the
imagined community. Thus today, even the most insular nations accept the principle of
naturalization (wonderful word!), no matter how difficult in practice they may make it.
[146] Seen as both a historical fatality and as a community imagined through language, the
nation presents itself as simultaneously open and closed. This paradox is well illustrated in
the shifting rhythms of these famous lines on the death of John Moore during the battle of
Coruna:7
1. Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,
As his corse to the rampart we hurried;
Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot
O'er the grave where our hero we buried.
2. We buried him darkly at dead of night,
The sods with our bayonets turning;
By the struggling moonbeams' misty light,
And the lantern dimly burning.
3. No useless coffin enclosed his breast,
Not in sheet or in shroud we wound him;
But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,
With his martial cloak around him...
5. We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,
And smoothed down his lonely pillow,
That the foe and the stranger would tread o'er his head
And we far away on the billow...
8. Slowly and sadly we laid him down.
From the field of his fame fresh and gory;
We carved not a line, and we raised not a stone –
But we left him alone with his glory!
The lines celebrate a heroic memory with a beauty inseparable from the English language -
one untranslatable, audible only to its speakers and readers. Yet both Moore and his eulogist
were Irishmen. And there is no reason why a descendant of Moore's French or Spanish 'foes'
can not fully hear the poem's resonance: English, like any other language, is always open to
new speakers, listeners, and readers.
[147] Listen to Thomas Browne, encompassing in a pair of sentences the length and breadth
of man's history:8
Even the old ambitions had the advantage of ours, in the attempts of their vainglories, who acting
early and before the probable Meridian of time, have by this time found great accomplishment of
their designs, whereby the ancient Heroes have already out-lasted their Monuments, and
Mechanicall preservations. But in this latter Scene of time we cannot expect such Mummies unto
our memories, when ambition may fear the Prophecy of Elias, and Charles the Fifth can never
hope to live within two Methusela's of Hector.
Here ancient Egypt, Greece, and Judaea are united with the Holy Roman Empire, but their
unification across thousands of years and thousands of miles is accomplished within the
particularity of Browne's seventeenth-century English prose.9 The passage can, of course, up
to a point be translated. But the eerie splendour of 'probable Meridian of time,' 'Mechanicall
preservations,' 'such Mummies unto our memories,' and 'two Methusela's of Hector'can bring
goose-flesh to the napes only of English-readers.
On this page, it opens itself wide to the reader. On the other hand, the no less eerie splendour
of the final lines of'Yang SudahHilang'by the great Indonesian author Pramoedya Ananta

takkan terulangi lagi. Tapi seperti juga halnya dengan kali Lusi yang abadi menggarisi kota Blora,

mengalir kemuaranya, kelaut yang tak bertepi. Dan tak seorangpun tahu kapan laut itu akan kering
dan berhenti berdeburan.

If every language is acquirable, its acquisition requires a real portion of a person's life: each
new conquest is measured against shortening days. What limits one's access to other
languages is not their imperviousness but one's own mortality. Hence a certain privacy to all
languages. French and American imperialists governed, exploited, and killed Vietnamese
over many years. But whatever else they made off with, the Vietnamese language stayed put.
Accordingly, only too often, a rage at Vietnamese 'inscrutability,' and that obscure despair
which engenders the venomous argots of dying colonialisms: 'gooks,' 'ratons', etc.12 (In the
longer run, the only responses to the vast privacy of the language of the oppressed are retreat
or further massacre.)
Such epithets are, in their inner form, characteristically racist, and decipherment of this form
will serve to show why Nairn is basically mistaken in arguing that racism and anti-semitism
derive from nationalism - and thus that 'seen in sufficient historical depth, fascism tells us
more about nationalism than any other episode. *13 A word like 'slant,' for example,
abbreviated from 'slant-eyed', does not simply express an ordinary political enmity. It erases
nation-ness by reducing the adversary to his biological physiognomy.14 It denies, by
substituting for, 'Vietnamese;'just as raton denies, by substituting for, 'Algerian'. At the same
time, it stirs 'Vietnamese' into a nameless sludge along with 'Korean,' 'Chinese,' 'Filipino,' and
so on. The character of this vocabulary may become still more evident if it is contrasted with
other Vietnam-War-period words like 'Charlie' and [149] 'V.C.', or from an earlier era,
'Boches,' 'Huns,' 'Japs' and 'Frogs,'all of which apply only to one specific nationality, and thus
concede, in hatred, the adversary's membership in a league of nations.15
The fact of the matter is that nationalism thinks in terms of historical destinies, while racism
dreams of eternal contaminations, transmitted from the origins of time through an endless
sequence of loathsome copulations: outside history. Niggers are, thanks to the invisible tarbrush,
forever niggers; Jews, the seed of Abraham, forever Jews, no matter what passports
they carry or what languages they speak and read. (Thus for the Nazi, the Jewish German was
always an impostor.)16
The dreams of racism actually have their origin in ideologies of class, rather than in those of
nation: above all in claims to divinity among rulers and to 'blue' or 'white' blood and
'breeding' among aristocracies.17 No surprise then that the putative sire of modern racism
should be, not some petty-bourgeois nationalist, but Joseph Arthur, Comte de Gobineau.18
Nor that, on the whole, racism and [150] anti-semitism manifest themselves, not across
national boundaries, but within them. In other words, they justify not so much foreign wars as
domestic repression and domination.19
Where racism developed outside Europe in the nineteenth century, it was always associated
with European domination, for two converging reasons. First and most important was the rise
of official nationalism and colonial 'Russification'. As has been repeatedly emphasized
official nationalism was typically a response on the part of threatened dynastic and
aristocratic groups - upper classes - to popular vernacular nationalism. Colonial racism was a
major element in that conception of 'Empire' which attempted to weld dynastic legitimacy
and national community. It did so by generalizing a principle of innate, inherited superiority
on which its own domestic position was (however shakily) based to the vastness of the
overseas possessions, covertly (or not so covertly) conveying the idea that if, say, English
lords were naturally superior to other Englishmen, no matter: these other Englishmen were no
less superior to the subjected natives. Indeed one is tempted to argue that the existence of late
colonial empires even served to shore up domestic aristocratic bastions, since they appeared
to confirm on a global, modern stage antique conceptions of power and privilege.
It could do so with some effect because-and here is our second reason- the colonial empire,
with its rapidly expanding bureaucratic apparatus and its 'Russifying' policies, permitted
sizeable numbers of bourgeois and petty bourgeois to play aristocrat off centre court: i.e.
anywhere in the empire except at home. In each colony one found this grimly amusing
tableau vivant: the bourgeois gentilhomme speaking poetry against a backcloth of spacious
mansions and gardens filled with mimosa and bougainvillea, and a large supporting cast of
houseboys, grooms, gardeners, cooks, amahs, maids, washerwomen, [151] and, above all,
horses.20 Even those who did not manage to live in this style, such as young bachelors,
nonetheless had the grandly equivocal status of a French nobleman on the eve of a
jacquerie:21
In Moulmein, in lower Burma [this obscure town needs explaining to readers in the metropole], I
was hated by large numbers of people - the only time in my life that I have been important enough
for this to happen to me. I was sub-divisional police officer of the town.
This 'tropical Gothic' was made possible by the overwhelming power that high capitalism had
given the metropole - a power so great that it could be kept, so to speak, in the wings.
Nothing better illustrates capitalism in feudal-aristocratic drag than colonial militaries, which
were notoriously distinct from those of the metropoles, often even in formal institutional
terms.22 Thus in Europe one had the 'First Army,' recruited by conscription on a mass, citizen,
metropolitan base; ideologically conceived as the defender of the heimat; dressed in practical,
utilitarian khaki; armed with the latest affordable weapons; in peacetime isolated in barracks,
in war stationed in trenches or behind heavy field-guns. Outside Europe one had the 'Second
Army,' recruited (below the officer level) from local religious or ethnic minorities on a
mercenary basis; ideologically conceived as an internal police force; dressed to kill in bed- or
ballroom; armed with swords and obsolete industrial weapons; in peace on display, in war on
horseback. If the Prussian General Staff, Europe's military teacher, stressed the
anonymous solidarity of a professionalized corps, ballistics, railroads, engineering, strategic
planning, and the like, the colonial army stressed glory, epaulettes, personal heroism, polo,
and an archaizing courtliness among its officers. (It could afford [152] to do so because the
First Army and the Navy were there in the background.) This mentality survived a long time.
In Tonkin, in 1894, Lyautey wrote:23
Quel dommage de n'être pas venu ici dix ans plus tôt! Quelles carrières à y fonder et à y mener. Il
n'y a pas ici un de ces petits lieutenants, chefs de poste et de reconnaissance, qui ne développe en 6
mois plus d’initiative, de volonté, d'endurance, de personnalité, qu'un officier de France en toute sa
carrière.
In Tonkin, in 1951, Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, ‘who liked officers who combined guts with
"style," took an immediate liking to the dashing cavalryman [Colonel de Castries] with his
bright-red Spahi cap and scarf, his magnificent riding-crop, and his combination of easygoing
manners and ducal mien, which made him as irresistible to women in Indochina in the
1950s as he had been to Parisiennes of the 1930s.’24
Another instructive indication of the aristocratic or pseudo-aristocratic derivation of colonial
racism was the typical 'solidarity [153] among whites,' which linked colonial rulers from
different national metropoles, whatever their internal rivalries and conflicts. This solidarity,
in its curious trans-state character, reminds one instantly of the class solidarity of Europe's
nineteenth-century aristocracies, mediated through each other's hunting-lodges, spas, and
ballrooms; and of that brotherhood of 'officers and gentlemen,' which in the Geneva
convention guaranteeing privileged treatment to captured enemy officers, as opposed to
partisans or civilians, has an agreeably twentieth-century expression.
The argument adumbrated thus far can also be pursued from the side of colonial populations.
For, the pronouncements of certain colonial ideologues aside, it is remarkable how little that
dubious entity known as 'reverse racism' manifested itself in the anticolonial movements. In
this matter it is easy to be deceived by language. There is, for example, a sense in which the
Javanese word londo (derived from Hollander or Nederlander) meant not only 'Dutch' but
'whites.' But the derivation itself shows that, for Javanese peasants, who scarcely ever
encountered any 'whites' but Dutch, the two meanings effectively overlapped. Similaj-ly, in
French colonial territories, 'les blancs' meant rulers whose Frenchness was indistinguishable
from their whiteness. In neither case, so far as I know, did londo or blanc either lose caste or
breed derogatory secondary distinctions.25
On the contrary, the spirit of anticolonial nationalism is that of the heart-rending Constitution
of Makario Sakay's short-lived Republic of Katagalugan (1902), which said, among other
things:26
[154] No Tagalog, born in this Tagalog archipelago, shall exalt any person above the rest because
of his race or the colour of his skin; fair, dark, rich, poor, educated and ignorant - all are
completely equal, and should be in one loob [inward spirit]. There may be differences in
education, wealth, or appearance, but never in essential nature (pagkatao) and ability to serve a
cause.
One can find without difficulty analogies on the other side of the globe. Spanish-speaking
mestizo Mexicans trace their ancestries, not to Castilian conquistadors, but to half-obliterated
Aztecs, Mayans, Toltecs and Zapotecs. Uruguayan revolutionary patriots, Creoles
themselves, took up the name of Tupac Amaru, the last great indigenous rebel against creole
oppression, who died under unspeakable tortures in 1781.
It may appear paradoxical that the objects of all these attachments are 'imagined' -
anonymous, faceless fellow-Tagalogs, exterminated tribes, Mother Russia, or the tanah air.
But amor patriae does not differ in this respect from the other affections, in which there is
always an element of fond imagining. (This is why looking at the photo-albums of strangers'
weddings is like studying the archaeologist's groundplan of the Hanging Gardens of
Babylon.) What the eye is to the lover - that particular, ordinary eye he or she is born with -
language - whatever language history has made his or her mother-tongue - is to the patriot.
Through that language, encountered at mother's knee and parted with only at the grave, pasts
are restored, fellowships are imagined, and futures dreamed.

that these enemies have no identity and could as well be Englishmen as anyone else since they are 'her/his'

1. Farewell, dear Land, beloved of the sun,
Pearl of the Orient seas, lost Paradise!
Gladly, I will to you this life undone;
Were it a fairer, fresher, fuller one,
I'd cede it still, your weal to realize...
12. What matters then that you forget me, when
I might explore your ev'ry dear retreat?
Be as a note, pulsing and pure; and then,
Be scent, light, tone; be song or sign, again;
And through it all, my theme of faith, repeat.
13. Land I enshrine, list to my last farewell!
Philippines, Love, of pains my pain extreme,
I leave you all, all whom I love so well,
To go where neither slaves nor tyrants dwell,
Where Faith kills not, and where God reigns supreme.
14. Farewell to all my soul does comprehend –
O kith and kin in my home dispossessed;
Give thanks my day oppressive is at end;
Farewell, sweet stranger, my delight and friend;
Farewell, dear ones. To die is but to rest.

Republican France. However, the often talkative Grande Muette had since the start of the Third Republic been
an asylum for aristocrats increasingly excluded from power in all other important institutions of public life. By
1898, a full quarter of all Brigadier- and Major-Generals were aristocrats. Moreover, this aristocrat-dominated
officer corps was crucial to nineteenth and twentieth-century French imperialism. 'The rigorous control imposed
on the army in the metropole never extended fully to la France d'outre-mer. The extension of the French Empire
in the nineteenth century was partially the result of uncontrolled initiative on the part of colonial military
commanders. French West Africa, largely the creation of General Faidherbe, and the French Congo as well,
owed most of their expansion to independent military forays into the hinterland. Military officers were also
responsible for thefaits accomplis which led to a French protectorate in Tahiti in 1842, and, to a lesser extent, to
the French occupation of Tonkin in Indochina in the 1880's... In 1897 Gallieni summarily abolished the

25. I have never heard of an abusive argot word in Indonesian or Javanese for either 'Dutch' or 'white.' Compare
the Anglo-Saxon treasury: niggers, wops, kikes, gooks, slants, fuzzywuzzies, and a hundred more. It is possible
that this innocence of racist argots is true primarily of colonized populations. Blacks in America-and surely
elsewhere - have developed a varied counter-vocabulary (honkies, ofays, etc.).

immigration had produced a sizeable mestizo population in the islands.
9. The Angel of History
[155] We began this brief study with the recent wars between the Socialist Republic of
Vietnam, Democratic Kampuchea, and the People's Republic of China; so it is only fitting to
return finally to that point of departure. Does anything of what has meantime been said help
to deepen our understanding of their outbreak?
In The Break-up of Britain, Tom Nairn has some valuable words on the relationship between
the British political system and those of the rest of the modern world.1
Alone, [the British system] represented a 'slow, conventional growth, not like the others, the
product of deliberate invention, resulting from a theory.' Arriving later, those others 'attempted to
sum up at a stroke the fruits of the experience of the state which had evolved its constitutionalism
through several centuries'... Because it was first, the English - later British - experience remained
distinct. Because they came second, into a world where the English Revolution had already
succeeded and expanded, later bourgeois societies could not repeat this early development. Their
study and imitation engendered something substantially different: the truly modern doctrine of the
abstract [156] or 'impersonal' state which, because of its abstract nature, could be imitated in
subsequent history.
This may of course be seen as the ordinary logic of developmental processes. It was an early
specimen of what was later dignified with such titles as 'the law of uneven and combined
development.' Actual repetition and imitation are scarcely ever possible, whether politically,
economically, socially, or technologically, because the universe is already too much altered by the
first cause one is copying.
What Nairn says of the modern state is no less true of the twin conceptions of which our three
embattled socialist countries are contemporary realizations: revolution and nationalism. It is
perhaps too easy to forget that this pair, like capitalism and Marxism, are inventions, on
which patents are impossible to preserve. They are there, so to speak, for the pirating. Out of
these piracies and only out of them, comes this well-known anomaly: societies such as those
of Cuba, Albania, and China, which, insofar as they are revolutionary-socialist, conceive of
themselves as 'ahead' of those of France, Switzerland, and the United States, but which,
insofar as they are characterized by low productivity, miserable living standards, and
backward technology, are no less certainly understood as 'behind.' (Thus Chou En-lai's
melancholy dream of catching up with capitalist Britain by the year 2000.)
As noted earlier, Hobsbawm was right to observe that 'the French Revolution was not made
or led by a formed party or movement in the modern sense, nor by men attempting to carry
out a systematic programme.' But, thanks to print-capitalism, the French experience was not
merely ineradicable from human memory, it was also learnable-from. Out of almost a century
of modular theorizing and practical experimentation came the Bolsheviks, who made the first
successful 'planned' revolution (even if the success would not have been possible without
Hindenburg's earlier triumphs at Tannenberg and the Masurian Lakes) and attempted to carry
out a systematic programme (even if in practice improvisation was the order of the day). It
also seems clear that without such plans and programmes a revolution in a realm barely
entering the era of industrial capitalism was out of the question. The Bolshevik revolutionary
model has been decisive for all twentieth-century revolutions because it made them [157]
imaginable in societies still more backward than All the Russias. (It opened the possibility of,
so to speak, cutting history off at the pass.) The skilful early experimentations of Mao Tsetung
confirmed the utility of the model outside Europe. One can thus see a sort of culmination
of the modular process in the case of Cambodia, where in 1962 less than 2.5 per cent of the
two-and-a-half-million-strong adult work-force was 'working class,' and less than 0.5 per cent
'capitalists.'2
In much the same way, since the end of the eighteenth century nationalism has undergone a
process of modulation and adaptation, according to different eras, political regimes,
economies and social structures. The 'imagined community' has, as a result, spread out to
every conceivable contemporary society. If it is permissible to use modern Cambodia to
illustrate an extreme modular transfer of 'revolution,' it is perhaps equitable to use Vietnam to
illustrate that of nationalism, by a brief excursus on the nation's name.
On his coronation in 1802, Gia-long wished to call his realm 'Nam Viet and sent envoys to
gain Peking's assent. The Manchu Son of Heaven, however, insisted that it be 'Vi6t Nam.'
The reason for this inversion is as follows: 'Viet Nam' (or in Chinese Yu'eh-nan) means,
roughly 'to the south of Viet (Yiieh),' a realm conquered by the Han seventeen centuries
earlier and reputed to cover today's Chinese provinces of Kwangtung and Kwangsi, as well as
the Red River valley. Gia-long's 'Nam ViSt,' however, meant 'Southern Vi?t/ Yiieh,' in effect
a claim to the old realm. In the words of Alexander Woodside, 'the name "Vietnam" as a
whole was hardly so well esteemed by Vietnamese rulers a century ago, emanating as it had
from Peking, as it is in this century. An artificial appellation then, it was used extensively
neither by the Chinese nor by the Vietnamese. The Chinese clung to the offensive T'ang word
"Annam"... The [158] Vietnamese court, on the other hand, privately invented another name
for its kingdom in 1838-39 and did not bother to inform the Chinese. Its new name, Dai Nam,
the "Great South" or "Imperial South," appeared with regularity on court documents and
official historical compilations. But it has not survived to the present.'3 This new name is
interesting in two respects. First, it contains no 'Viet'-namese element. Second, its territorial
reference seems purely relational - 'south' (of the Middle Kingdom).4
That today's Vietnamese proudly defend a Vi6t Nam scornfully invented by a nineteenthcentury
Manchu dynast reminds us of Renan's dictum that nations must have 'oublie bien des
choses,' but also, paradoxically, of the imaginative power of nationalism.
If one looks back at the Vietnam of the 1930s or the Cambodia of the 1960s, one finds,
mutatis mutandis, many similarities: a huge, illiterate, exploited peasantry, a minuscule
working class, a fragmentary bourgeoisie, and a tiny, divided intelligentsia.5 No sober
contemporary analyst, viewing these conditions objectively, would in either case have
predicted the revolutions soon to follow, or their wrecked triumphs. (In fact, much the same
could be said, and for much the same reasons, of the China of 1910.) What made them
possible, in the end, was 'planning revolution' and 'imagining the nation.'6
[159] The policies of the Pol Pot regime can only in a very limited sense be attributed to
traditional Khmer culture or to its leaders' cruelty, paranoia, and megalomania. The Khmer
have had their share of megalomaniac despots; some of these, however, were responsible for
Angkor. Far more important are the models of what revolutions have, can, should, and should
not do, drawn from France, the USSR, China, and Vietnam-and all the books written about
them in French.7
Much the same is true of nationalism. Contemporary nationalism is the heir to two centuries
of historic change. For all the reasons that I have attempted to sketch out, the legacies are
truly Janus-headed. For the legators include not only San Martin and Garibaldi, but Uvarov
and Macaulay. As we have seen, 'official nationalism' was from the start a conscious, selfprotective
policy, intimately linked to the preservation of imperial-dynastic interests. But
once 'out there for all to see,' it was as copyable as Prussia's early-nineteenth-century military
reforms, and by the same variety of political and social systems. The one persistent feature of
this style of nationalism was, and is, that it is official-i.e. something emanating from the state,
and serving the interests of the state first and foremost.
Thus the model of official nationalism assumes its relevance above all at the moment when
revolutionaries successfully take control of the state, and are for the first time in a position to
use the power of the state in pursuit of their visions. The relevance is all the greater insofar as
even the most determinedly radical revolutionaries always, to some degree, inherit the state
from the fallen regime. Some of these [160] legacies are symbolic, but not the less important
for that. Despite Trotsky's unease, the capital of the USSR was moved back to the old Czarist
capital of Moscow; and for over 65 years CPSU leaders have made policy in the Kremlin,
ancient citadel of Czarist power - out of all possible sites in the socialist state's vast
territories. Similarly, the PRC's capital is that of the Manchus (while Chiang Kai-shek had
moved it to Nanking), and the CCP leaders congregate in the Forbidden City of the Sons of
Heaven. In fact, there are very few, if any, socialist leaderships which have not clambered up
into such worn, warm seats. At a less obvious level, successful revolutionaries also inherit the
wiring of the old state: sometimes functionaries and informers, but always files, dossiers,
archives, laws, financial records, censuses, maps, treaties, correspondence, memoranda, and
so on. Like the complex electrical system in any large mansion when the owner has fled, the
state awaits the new owner's hand at the switch to be very much its old brilliant self again.
One should therefore not be much surprised if revolutionary leaderships, consciously or
unconsciously, come to play lord of the manor. We are not thinking here simply of
Djugashvili's self-identification with Ivan Groznii, or Mao's expressed admiration for the
tyrant Ch'in Shih Huang-ti, or Josip Broz's revival of Ruritanian pomp and ceremony.8
'Official nationalism' enters post-revolutionary leadership styles in a much more subtle way.
By this I mean that such leaderships come easily to adopt the putative nationalnost of the
older dynasts and the dynastic state. In a striking retroactive movement, dynasts who knew
nothing of 'China,' 'Yugoslavia,' 'Vietnam' or 'Cambodia' become nationals (even if not
always 'deserving' nationals). Out of this accommodation comes invariably that 'state'
Machiavellism which is so striking a feature of post-revolutionary regimes in contrast to
revolutionary nationalist movements. The more the ancient dynastic state is naturalized, the
more its antique finery can be wrapped around revolutionary shoulders. The image of
Jayavarman VH's Angkor, emblazoned on the flag of Marxist Democratic Kampuchea (as on
those of Lon Nol's puppet republic [161] and of Sihanouk's monarchical Cambodge), is a
rebus not of piety but of power.9
I emphasize leaderships, because it is leaderships, not people, who inherit old switchboards
and palaces. No one imagines, I presume, that the broad masses of the Chinese people give a
fig for what happens along the colonial border between Cambodia and Vietnam. Nor is it at
all likely that Khmer and Vietnamese peasants wanted wars between their peoples, or were
consulted in the matter. In a very real sense these were 'chancellory wars' in which popular
nationalism was mobilized largely after the fact and always in a language of self-defence.
(Hence the particularly low enthusiasm in China, where this language was least plausible,
even under the neon-lit blazon of 'Soviet hegemonism.')10
In all of this, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia are not in the least unique.11 This is why there
are small grounds for hope that the precedents they have set for inter-socialist wars will not
be followed, or that the imagined community of the socialist nation will soon be remaindered.
But nothing can be usefully done to limit or prevent such wars unless we abandon fictions
like 'Marxists as such are not nationalists,' or 'nationalism is the pathology of modern
developmental history,' and, instead, do our slow best to learn the real, and imagined,
experience of the past.
Of the Angel of History, Walter Benjamin wrote that:12
[162] His face is turned towards the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single
catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel
would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is
blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no
longer close them. This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned,
while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress.
But the Angel is immortal, and our faces are turned towards the obscurity ahead.

10. Census, Map, Museum
[163] In the original edition of Imagined Communities I wrote that 'so often in the "nationbuilding"
policies of the new states one sees both a genuine, popular nationalist enthusiasm,
and a systematic, even Machiavellian, instilling of nationalist ideology through the mass
media, the educational system, administrative regulations, and so forth.'1 My short-sighted
assumption then was that official nationalism in the colonized worlds of Asia and Africa was
modelled directly on that of the dynastic states of nineteenth-century Europe. Subsequent
reflection has persuaded me that this view was hasty and superficial, and that the immediate
genealogy should be traced to the imaginings of the colonial state. At first sight, this
conclusion may seem surprising, since colonial states were typically anti-nationalist, and
often violently so. But if one looks beneath colonial ideologies and policies to the grammar in
which, from the mid nineteenth century, they were deployed, the lineage becomes decidedly
more clear.
Few things bring this grammar into more visible relief than three institutions of power which,
although invented before the mid nineteenth century, changed their form and function as the
colonized zones entered the age of mechanical reproduction. These three institutions were the
census, the map, and the museum: together, they [164] profoundly shaped the way in which
the colonial state imagined its dominion - the nature of the human beings it ruled, the
geography of its domain, and the legitimacy of its ancestry. To explore the character of this
nexus I shall, in this chapter, confine my attention to Southeast Asia, since my conclusions
are tentative, and my claims to serious specialization limited to that region. Southeast Asia
does, however, offer those with comparative historical interests special advantages, since it
includes territories colonized by almost all the 'white' imperial powers - Britain, France,
Spain, Portugal, The Netherlands, and the United States - as well as uncolonized Siam.
Readers with greater knowledge of other parts of Asia and Africa than mine will be better
positioned to judge if my argument is sustainable on a wider historical and geographical
stage.
THE CENSUS
In two valuable recent papers the sociologist Charles Hirschman has begun the study of the
mentalites of the British colonial census-makers for the Straits Settlements and peninsular
Malaya, and their successors working for the independent conglomerate state of Malaysia.2
Hirschman's facsimiles of the 'identity categories' of successive censuses from the late
nineteenth century up to the recent present show an extraordinarily rapid, superficially
arbitrary, series of changes, in which categories are continuously agglomerated,
disaggregated, recombined, intermixed, and reordered (but the politically powerful identity
categories always lead the list). From these censuses he draws two principal conclusions. The
first is that, as the colonial period wore on, the census categories became more visibly and
exclusively racial.3 Religious identity, on the other hand, [165] gradually disappeared as a
primary census classification. 'Hindoos'-ranked alongside 'Klings,' and 'Bengalees'-vanished
after the first census of 1871. 'Parsees' lasted until the census of 1901, where they still
appeared - packed in with 'Bengalis,' 'Burmese,' and 'Tamils'-under the broad category
'Tamils and Other Natives of India.' His second conclusion is that, on the whole, the large
racial categories were retained and even concentrated after independence, but now
redesignated and reranked as 'Malaysian,' 'Chinese,' 'Indian,' and 'Other.' Yet anomalies
continued up into the 1980s. In the 1980 census 'Sikh' still appeared nervously as a
pseudoethnic subcategory - alongside 'Malayah" and 'Telegu,' 'Pakistani' and 'Bangladeshi,'
'Sri Lankan Tamil,' and 'Other Sri Lankan,'- under the general heading 'Indian.'
But Hirschman's wonderful facsimiles encourage one to go beyond his immediate analytical
concerns. Take, for example, the 1911 Federated Malay States Census, which lists under
'Malay Population by Race' the following: 'Malay,' 'Javanese,' 'Sakai,' 'Banjarese,' 'Boyanese,'
'Mendeling' (sic), 'Krinchi' (sic), 'Jambi,' 'Achinese,' 'Bugis,' and 'Other.' Of these 'groups' all
but (most) 'Malay' and 'Sakai' originated from the islands of Sumatra, Java, Southern Borneo,
and the Celebes, all parts of the huge neighboring colony of the Netherlands East Indies. But
these extra-FMS origins receive no recognition from the census-makers who, in constructing
their 'Malays,' keep their eyes modestly lowered to their own colonial borders. (Needless to
say, across the waters, Dutch census-makers were constructing a different imagining of
'Malays,' as a minor ethnicity alongside, not above, 'Achinese,' 'Javanese,' and the like.)
'Jambi' and 'Krinchi' refer to places, rather than to anything remotely identifiable as
ethnolinguistic. It is extremely unlikely that, in 1911, more than a tiny fraction of those
categorized and subcategorized would have recognized themselves under such labels. These
'identities,' imagined by the (confusedly) classifying mind of the colonial state, still awaited a
reification which imperial administrative penetration would soon make possible. One notices,
in [166] addition, the census-makers' passion for completeness and un-ambiguity. Hence their
intolerance of multiple, politically 'trans-vestite,' blurred, or changing identifications. Hence
the weird subcategory, under each racial group, of'Others'- who, nonetheless, are absolutely
not to be confused with other 'Others.' The fiction of the census is that everyone is in it, and
that everyone has one - and only one - extremely clear place. No fractions.
This mode of imagining by the colonial state had origins much older than the censuses of the
1870s, so that, in order fully to understand why the late-nineteenth-century censuses are yet
profoundly novel, it is useful to look back to the earliest days of European penetration of
Southeast Asia. Two examples, drawn from the Philippine and Indonesian archipelagoes, are
instructive. In an important recent book, William Henry Scott has attempted meticulously to
reconstruct the class structure of the pre-Hispanic Philippines, on the basis of the earliest
Spanish records.4 As a professional historian Scott is perfectly aware that the Philippines
owes its name to Felipe II of 'Spain,' and that, but for mischance or luck, the archipelago
might have fallen into Dutch or English hands, become politically segmented, or been
recombined with further conquests.5 It is tempting therefore to attribute his curious choice of
topic to his long residence in the Philippines and his strong sympathy with a Filipino
nationalism that has been, for a century now, on the trail of an aboriginal Eden. But the
chances are good that the deeper basis for the shaping of his imagination was the sources on
which he was [167] compelled to rely. For the fact is that wherever in the islands the earliest
clerics and conquistadors ventured they espied, on shore, principals, hidalgos, pecheros, and
esclavos (princes, noblemen, commoners and slaves) - quasi-estates adapted from the social
classifications of late mediaeval Iberia. The documents they left behind offer plenty of
incidental evidence that the 'hidalgos' were mostly unaware of one another's existence in the
huge, scattered, and sparsely populated archipelago, and, where aware, usually saw one
another not as hidalgos, but as enemies or potential slaves. But the power of the grid is so
great that such evidence is marginalized in Scott's imagination, and therefore it is hard for
him to see that the 'class structure' of the precolonial period is a 'census' imagining created
from the poops of Spanish galleons. Wherever they went, hidalgos andesclavos loomed up,
who could only be aggregated as such, that is 'structurally,' by an incipient colonial state.
For Indonesia we have, thanks to the research of Mason Hoadley, a detailed account of an
important judicial case decided in the coastal port of Cirebon, Java, at the end of the
seventeenth century.6 By luck, the Dutch (VOC) and local Cirebonese records are still
available. If the Cirebonese account only had survived, we would know the accused murderer
as a high official of the Cirebonese court, and only by his title Ki Aria Marta Ningrat, not a
personal name. The VOC records, however, angrily identify him as a Chinees - indeed that is
the single most important piece of information about him that they convey. It is clear then
that the Cirebonese court classified people by rank and status, while the Company did so by
something like 'race.' There is no reason whatever to think that the accused murderer-whose
high status attests to his and his ancestors' long integration into Cirebonese society, no matter
what their origins - thought of himself as 'a' Chinees. How then did the VOC arrive at this
classification? From what poops was it possible to imagine Chinees'? Surely only those
ferociously mercantile poops which, under centralized command, roved ceaselessly from port
to port between the Gulf of Mergui and the mouth of the Yangtze-kiang. Oblivious of the
[168] heterogeneous populations of the Middle Kingdom; of the mutual incomprehensibility
of many of their spoken languages; and of the peculiar social and geographic origins of their
diaspora across coastal Southeast Asia, the Company imagined, with its trans-oceanic eye, an
endless series of Chinezen, as the conquistadors had seen an endless series of hidalgos. And
on the basis of this inventive census it began to insist that those under its control whom it
categorized as Chinezen dress, reside, marry, be buried, and bequeath property according to
that census. It is striking that the much less far-faring and commercially minded Iberians in
the Philippines imagined a quite different census category: what they called sangley. Sangley
was an incorporation into Spanish of the Hokkiensengli - meaning 'trader.*7 One can imagine
Spanish proto-census men asking the traders drawn to Manila by the galleon trade: 'Who are
you?', and being sensibly told: 'We are traders.'8 Not sailing the seven Asian seas, for two
centuries the Iberians remained in a comfortably provincial conceptual fog. Only very slowly
did the sangley turn into 'Chinese'-until the word disappeared in the early nineteenth century
to make way for a VOC-style chino.
The real innovation of the census-takers of the 1870s was, therefore, not in the construction
of ethnic-racial classifications, but rather in their systematic quantification. Precolonial rulers
in the Malayo-Javanese world had attempted enumerations of the populations under their
control, but these took the form of tax-rolls and levy-lists. Their purposes were concrete and
specific: to keep track of those on whom taxes and military conscription could effectively be
imposed- for these rulers were interested solely in economic surplus and armable manpower.
Early European regimes in the region did not, in this respect, differ markedly from their
predecessors. But after 1850 colonial authorities were using increasingly sophisticated
administrative means to enumerate populations, including the women and children (whom the
ancient rulers had always ignored), [169] according to a maze of grids which had no
immediate financial or military purpose. In the old days, those subjects liable for taxes and
conscription were usually well aware of their numerability; ruler and ruled understood each
other very well, if antagonistically, on the matter. But by 1870, a non-taxpaying, unlevyable
'Cochin-Chinese' woman could live out her life, happily or unhappily, in the Straits
Settlements, without the slightest awareness that this was how she was being mapped from on
high. Here the peculiarity of the new census becomes apparent. It tried carefully to count the
objects of its feverish imagining. Given the exclusive nature of the classificatory system, and
the logic of quantification itself, a 'Cochin-Chinese'had to be understood as one digit in an
aggregable series of replicable 'Cochin-Chinese'-within, of course, the state's domain. The
new demographic topography put down deep social and institutional roots as the colonial
state multiplied its size and functions. Guided by its imagined map it organized the new
educational, juridical, public-health, police, and immigration bureaucracies it was building on
the principle of ethno-racial hierarchies which were, however, always understood in terms of
parallel series. The flow of subject populations through the mesh of differential schools,
courts, clinics, police stations and immigration offices created 'traffic-habits' which in time
gave real social life to the state's earlier fantasies.
Needless to say, it was not always plain sailing, and the state frequently bumped into
discomforting realities. Far and away the most important of these was religious affiliation,
which served as the basis of very old, very stable imagined communities not in the least
aligned with the secular state's authoritarian grid-map. To different degrees, in different
Southeast Asian colonies, the rulers were compelled to make messy accommodations,
especially to Islam and Buddhism. In particular, religious shrines, schools, and courts - access
to which was determined by individual popular self-choice, not the census - continued to
flourish. The state could rarely do more than try to regulate, constrict, count, standardize, and
hierarchically subordinate these institutions to its own.9 It was precisely because [170]
temples, mosques, schools and courts were topographically anomalous that they were
understood as zones of freedom and - in time -fortresses from which religious, later
nationalist, anticolonials could go forth to battle. At the same time, there were frequent
endeavours to force a better alignment of census with religious communities by- so far as was
possible - politically and juridically ethnicizing the latter. In the Federated States of colonial
Malaya, this task was relatively easy. Those whom the regime regarded as being in the series
'Malay' were hustled off to the courts of 'their' castrated Sultans, which were in substantial
part administered according to Islamic law.10 'Islamic' was thus treated as really just another
name for 'Malay.' (Only after independence in 1957 were efforts made by certain political
groups to reverse this logic by reading 'Malay' as really another name for 'Islamic'). In the
vast, heterogeneous Netherlands Indies, where by the end of the colonial era an array of
quarrelling missionary organizations had made substantial conversions in widely scattered
zones, a parallel drive faced much more substantial obstacles. Yet even there, the 1920s and
1930s saw the growth of 'ethnic' Christianities (the Batak Church, the Karo Church, later the
Dayak Church, and so on) which developed in part because the state allocated proselytizing
zones to different missionary groups according to its own census-topography. With Islam
Batavia had no comparable success. It did not dare to prohibit the pilgrimage to Mecca,
though it tried to inhibit the growth of the pilgrims' numbers, policed their travels, and spied
on them from an outpost at Jiddah set up just for this purpose. None of these measures
sufficed to prevent the intensification of Indies Muslim contacts with the vast world of Islam
outside, and especially the new currents of thought emanating from Cairo.11
THE MAP
In the meantime, however, Cairo and Mecca were beginning to be visualized in a strange new
way, no longer simply as sites in a sacred [171] Muslim geography, but also as dots on paper
sheets which included dots for Paris, Moscow, Manila and Caracas; and the plane relationship
between these indifferently profane and sacred dots was determined by nothing beyond the
mathematically calculated flight of the crow. The Mercatorian map, brought in by the
European colonizers, was beginning, via print, to shape the imagination of Southeast Asians.
In a recent, brilliant thesis the Thai historian Thongchai Wini-chakul has traced the complex
processes by which a bordered 'Siam' came into being between 1850 and 1910.12 His account
is instructive precisely because Siam was not colonized, though what, in the end, came to be
its borders were colonially determined. In the Thai case, therefore, one can see unusually
clearly the emergence of a new state-mind within a 'traditional' structure of political power.
Up until the accession, in 1851, of the intelligent Rama IV (the Mongkut of The King and I),
only two types of map existed in Siam, and both were hand-made: the age of mechanical
reproduction had not yet there dawned. One was what could be called a 'cosmograph,' a
formal, symbolic representation of the Three Worlds of traditional Buddhist cosmology. The
cosmograph was not organized horizontally, like our own maps; rather a series of
supraterrestrial heavens and subterrestrial hells wedged in the visible world along a single
vertical axis. It was useless for any journey save that in search of merit and salvation. The
second type, wholly profane, consisted of diagrammatic guides for military campaigns and
coastal shipping. Organized roughly by the quadrant, their main features were written-in
notes on marching and sailing times, required because the mapmakers had no technical
conception of scale. Covering only terrestrial, profane space, they were usually drawn in a
queer oblique perspective or mixture of perspectives, as if the drawers' eyes, accustomed
from daily life to see the landscape horizontally, at eye-level, nonetheless were influenced
subliminally by the verticality of the cosmograph. Thongchai points out that these guidemaps,
always local, were [172] never situated in a larger, stable geographic context, and that
the bird's-eye view convention of modern maps was wholly foreign to them.
Neither type of map marked borders. Their makers would have found incomprehensible the
following elegant formulation of Richard Muir:13
Located at the interfaces between adjacent state territories, international boundaries have a special
significance in determining the limits of sovereign authority and defining the spatial form of the
contained political regions.... Boundaries .. occur where the vertical interfaces between state
sovereignties intersect the surface of the earth.... As vertical interfaces, boundaries have no
horizontal extent....
Boundary-stones and similar markers did exist, and indeed multiplied along the western
fringes of the realm as the British pressed in from Lower Burma. But these stones were set up
discontinuously at strategic mountain passes and fords, and were often substantial distances
from corresponding stones set up by the adversary. They were understood horizontally, at eye
level, as extension points of royal power; not 'from the air.' Only in the 1870s did Thai
leaders begin thinking of boundaries as segments of a continuous map-line corresponding to
nothing visible on the ground, but demarcating an exclusive sovereignty wedged between
other sovereignties. In 1874 appeared the first geographical textbook, by the American
missionary J. W. Van Dyke - an early product of the print-capitalism that was by then
sweeping into Siam. In 1882, Rama V established a special mapping school in Bangkok. In
1892, Minister of Education Prince Damrong Rajanuphab, inaugurating a modern-style
school system for the country, made geography a compulsory subject at the junior secondary
level. In 1900, or thereabouts, was published Phumisat Sayam [Geography of Siam] by W.G.
Johnson, the model for all printed geographies of the country from that time onwards.14
[173] Thongchai notes that the vectoral convergence of print-capitalism with the new
conception of spatial reality presented by these maps had an immediate impact on the
vocabulary of Thai politics. Between 1900 and 1915, the traditional words krung and muang
largely disappeared, because they imaged dominion in terms of sacred capitals and visible,
discontinuous population centers.15 In their place came prathet, 'country,' which imaged it in
the invisible terms of bounded territorial space.16
Like censuses, European-style maps worked on the basis of a totalizing classification, and led
their bureaucratic producers and consumers towards policies with revolutionary
consequences. Ever since John Harrison's 1761 invention of the chronometer, which made
possible the precise calculation of longitudes, the entire planet's curved surface had been
subjected to a geometrical grid which squared off empty seas and unexplored regions in
measured boxes.17 The task of, as it were, 'filling in' the boxes was to be accomplished by
explorers, surveyors, and military forces. In Southeast Asia, the second half of the nineteenth
century was the golden age of military surveyors - colonial and, a little later, Thai. They were
on the march to put space under the same surveillance which the census-makers were trying
to impose on persons. Triangulation by triangulation, war by war, treaty by treaty, the
alignment of map and power proceeded. In the apt words of Thongchai:18
In terms of most communication theories and common sense, a map is a scientific abstraction of
reality. A map merely represents something which already exists objectively 'there.' In the history I
have described, this relationship was reversed. A map anticipated spatial reality, not vice versa. In
other words, a map was a model for, rather than a model of, what it purported to represent.... It had
become a [174] real instrument to concretize projections on the earth's surface. A map was now
necessary for the new administrative mechanisms and for the troops to back up their claims. . . .
The discourse of mapping was the paradigm which both administrative and military operations
worked within and served.
By the turn of the century, with Prince Damrong's reforms at the Ministry of the Interior (a
fine mapping name), the administration of the realm was finally put on a wholly territorialcartographic
basis, following earlier practice in the neighboring colonies.
It would be unwise to overlook the crucial intersection between map and census. For the new
map served firmly to break off the infinite series of'Hakkas,' 'Non-Tamil Sri Lankans,' and
'Javanese' that the formal apparatus of the census conjured up, by delimiting territorially
where, for political purposes, they ended. Conversely, by a sort of demographic triangulation,
the census filled in politically the formal topography of the map.
Out of these changes emerged two final avatars of the map (both instituted by the late
colonial state) which directly prefigure the official nationalisms of twentieth century
Southeast Asia. Fully aware of their interloper status in the distant tropics, but arriving from a
civilization in which the legal inheritance and the legal transferability of geographic space
had long been established,19 the Europeans frequently attempted to legitimize the spread of
their power by quasi-legal methods. Among the more popular of these was their 'inheritance'
of the putative sovereignties of native rulers whom the Europeans had eliminated or
subjected. Either way, the usurpers were in the business, especially vis-a-vis other Europeans,
of reconstructing the property-history of their new possessions. Hence the appearance, late in
the nineteenth century especially, of 'historical maps,' designed to demonstrate, in the new
cartographic [175] discourse, the antiquity of specific, tightly bounded territorial units.
Through chronologically arranged sequences of such maps, a sort of political-biographical
narrative of the realm came into being, sometimes with vast historical depth.20 In turn, this
narrative was adopted, if often adapted, by the nation-states which, in the twentieth century,
became the colonial states' legatees.21
The second avatar was the map-as-logo. Its origins were reasonably innocent - the practice of
the imperial states of coloring their colonies on maps with an imperial dye. In London's
imperial maps, British colonies were usually pink-red, French purple-blue, Dutch yellowbrown,
and so on. Dyed this way, each colony appeared like a detachable piece of a jigsaw
puzzle. As this jigsaw' effect became normal, each 'piece' could be wholly detached from its
geographic context. In its final form all explanatory glosses could be summarily removed:
lines of longitude and latitude, place names, signs for rivers, seas, and mountains,
neighbours. Pure sign, no longer compass to the world. In this shape, the map entered an
infinitely reproducible series, available for transfer to posters, official seals, letterheads,
magazine and textbook covers, tablecloths, and hotel walls. Instantly recognizable,
everywhere visible, the logo-map penetrated deep into the popular imagination, forming a
powerful emblem for the anticolonial nationalisms being born.22
[176] Modern Indonesia offers us a fine, painful example of this process. In 1828 the first
fever-ridden Dutch settlement was made on the island of New Guinea. Although the
settlement had to be abandoned in 1836, the Dutch Crown proclaimed sovereignty over that
part of the island lying west of 141 degrees longitude (an invisible line which corresponded to
nothing on the ground, but boxed in Conrad's diminishing white spaces), with the exception
of some coastal stretches regarded as under the sovereignty of the Sultan of Tidore. Only in
1901 did The Hague buy out the Sultan, and incorporate West New Guinea into the
Netherlands Indies -just in time for logoization. Large parts of the region remained Conradwhite
until after World War II; the handful of Dutchmen there were mostly missionaries,
mineral-prospectors - and wardens of special prison-camps for die-hard radical Indonesian
nationalists. The swamps north of Merauke, at the extreme southeastern edge of Dutch New
Guinea, were selected as the site of these facilities precisely because the region was regarded
as utterly remote from the rest of the colony, and the 'stone-age' local population as wholly
uncontaminated by nationalist thinking.23
The internment, and often interment, there of nationalist martyrs gave West New Guinea a
central place in the folklore of the anticolonial struggle, and made it a sacred site in the
national imagining: Indonesia Free, from Sabang (at the northwestern tip of Sumatra) to -
where else but? - Merauke. It made no difference at all that, aside from the few hundred
internees, no nationalists ever saw New Guinea with their own eyes until the 1960s. But
Dutch colonial logo-maps sped across in the colony, showing a West New Guinea with
nothing to its East, unconsciously reinforced the developing imagined ties. When, in the
aftermath of the bitter anticolonial wars of 1945-49, the Dutch were forced to cede
sovereignty of the archipelago to a United States of Indonesia, they attempted (for reasons
that need not detain us here) to separate West New Guinea [177] once again, keep it
temporarily under colonial rule, and prepare it for independent nationhood. Not until 1963
was this enterprise abandoned, as a result of heavy American diplomatic pressure and
Indonesian military raids. Only then did President Sukarno visit for the first time, at the age
of sixty-two, a region about which he had tirelessly orated for four decades. The subsequent
painful relations between the populations of West New Guinea and the emissaries of the
independent Indonesian state can be attributed to the fact that Indonesians more or less
sincerely regard these populations as 'brothers and sisters,' while the populations themselves,
for the most part, see things very differently.24
This difference owes much to census and map. New Guinea's remoteness and rugged terrain
created over the millennia an extraordinary linguistic fragmentation. When the Dutch left the
region in 1963 they estimated that within the 700,000 population there existed well over 200
mostly mutually unintelligible languages.25 Many of the remoter 'tribal' groups were not even
aware of one another's existence. But, especially after 1950, Dutch missionaries and Dutch
officials for the first time made serious efforts to 'unify' them by taking censuses, expanding
communications networks, establishing schools, and erecting supra-'tribal' governmental
structures. This effort was launched by a colonial state which, as we noted earlier, was unique
in that it had governed the Indies, not primarily via a European language, but through
'administrative Malay.'26 Hence West New Guinea was 'brought up' in the same language in
which Indonesia had earlier been raised (and which became the national language in due
course). The irony is that bahasa Indonesia thus became [178] the lingua franca of a
burgeoning West New Guinean, West Papuan nationalism.27
But what brought the often quarrelling young West Papuan nationalists together, especially
after 1963, was the map. Though the Indonesian state changed the region's name from West
Nieuw Guinea, first to Irian Barat (West Irian) and then to Irian Jaya, it read its local reality
from the colonial-era bird's-eye atlas. A scattering of anthropologists, missionaries and local
officials might know and think about the Ndanis, the Asmats, and the Baudis. But the state
itself, and through it the Indonesian population as a whole, saw only a phantom 'Irianese'
(orang Irian) named after the map; because phantom, to be imagined in quasi-logo form:
'negroid' features, penis-sheaths, and so on. In a way that reminds us how Indonesia came
first to be imagined within the racist structures of the early-twentieth-century Netherlands
East Indies, an embryo 'Irianese' national community, bounded by Meridian 141 and the
neighboring provinces of North and South Moluccas, emerged. At the time when its most
prominent and attractive spokesman, Arnold Ap, was murdered by the state in 1984, he was
curator of a state-built museum devoted to 'Irianese' (provincial) culture.
THE MUSEUM
The link between Ap's occupation and assassination is not at all accidental. For museums, and
the museumizing imagination, are both profoundly political. That his museum was instituted
by a distant Jakarta shows us how the new nation-state of Indonesia learned from its
immediate ancestor, the colonial Netherlands East Indies. The present proliferation of
museums around Southeast Asia suggests a general process of political inheriting at work.
Any understanding of this process requires a consideration of the novel nineteenth-century
colonial archaeology that made such museums possible.
[179] Up until the early nineteenth century the colonial rulers in Southeast Asia exhibited
very little interest in the antique monuments of the civilizations they had subjected. Thomas
Stamford Raffles, ominous emissary from William Jones's Calcutta, was the first prominent
colonial official not merely to amass a large personal collection of local objets d'art, but
systematically to study their history.28 Thereafter, with increasing speed, the grandeurs of the
Borobudur, of Angkor, of Pagan, and of other ancient sites were successively disinterred,
unjungled, measured, photographed, reconstructed, fenced off, analysed, and displayed.29
Colonial Archaeological Services became powerful and prestigious institutions, calling on the
services of some exceptionally capable scholar-officials.30
[180] To explore fully why this happened, when it happened, would take us too far afield. It
may be enough here to suggest that the change was associated with the eclipse of the
commercial-colonial regimes of the two great East India Companies, and the rise of the true
modern colony, directly attached to the metropole.31 The prestige of the colonial state was
accordingly now intimately linked to that of its homeland superior. It is noticeable how
heavily concentrated archaeological efforts were on the restoration of imposing monuments
(and how these monuments began to be plotted on maps for public distribution and
edification: a kind of necrological census was under way). No doubt this emphasis reflected
general Orientalist fashions. But the substantial funds invested allow us to suspect that the
state had its own, non-scientific reasons. Three immediately suggest themselves, of which the
last is surely the most important.
In the first place, the timing of the archaeological push coincided with the first political
struggle over the state's educational policies.32 [181] 'Progressives'-colonials as well as
natives-were urging major investments in modern schooling. Against them were arrayed
conservatives who feared the long-term consequences of such schooling, and preferred the
natives to stay native. In this light, archaeological restorations - soon followed by statesponsored
printed editions of traditional literary texts- can be seen as a sort of conservative
educational program, which also served as a pretext for resisting the pressure of the
progressives. Second, the formal ideological programme of the reconstructions always placed
the builders of the monuments and the colonial natives in a certain hierarchy. In some cases,
as in the Dutch East Indies up until the 1930s, the idea was entertained that the builders were
actually not of the same 'race' as the natives (they were 'really'Indianimmigrants).33 In other
cases, as in Burma, what was imagined was a secular decadence, such that contemporary
natives were no longer capable of their putative ancestors' achievements. Seen in this light,
the reconstructed monuments, juxtaposed with the surrounding rural poverty, said to the
natives: Our very presence shows that you have always been, or have long become, incapable
of either greatness or self-rule.
The third reason takes us deeper, and closer to the map. We have seen earlier, in our
discussion of the 'historical map,' how colonial regimes began attaching themself to antiquity
as much as conquest, originally for quite straightforward Machiavellian-legalistic reasons. As
time passed, however, there was less and less openly brutal talk about right of conquest, and
more and more effort to create alternative legitimacies. More and more Europeans were being
born in Southeast Asia, and being tempted to make it their home. Monumental archaeology,
increasingly linked to tourism, allowed the state to appear as the guardian of a generalized,
but also local. Tradition. The old sacred sites were to be incorporated into the map of the
colony, and their ancient prestige (which, if this had [182] disappeared, as it often had, the
state would attempt to revive) draped around the mappers. This paradoxical situation is nicely
illustrated by the fact that the reconstructed monuments often had smartly laid-out lawns
around them, and always explanatory tablets, complete with datings, planted here and there.
Moreover, they were to be kept empty of people, except for perambulatory tourists (no
religious ceremonies or pilgrimages, so far as possible). Museumized this way, they were
repositioned as regalia for asecular colonial state.
But, as noted above, a characteristic feature of the instrumentalities of this profane state was
infinite reproducibility, a reproducibility made technically possible by print and photography,
but politico-culturally by the disbelief of the rulers themselves in the real sacredness of local
sites. A sort of progression is detectable everywhere: (1) massive, technically sophisticated
archaeological reports, complete with dozens of photographs, recording the process of
reconstruction of particular, distinct ruins; (2) Lavishly illustrated books for public
consumption, including exemplary plates of all the major sites reconstructed within the
colony (so much the better if, as in the Netherlands Indies, Hindu-Buddhist shrines could be
juxtaposed to restored Islamic mosques).34 Thanks to print-capitalism, a sort of pictorial
census of the state's patrimony becomes available, even if at high cost, to the state's subjects;
(3) A general logoization, made possible by the profaning processes outlined above. Postage
stamps, with their characteristic series- tropical birds, fruits, fauna, why not monuments as
well? - are exemplary of this stage. But postcards and schoolroom textbooks follow the same
logic. From there it is only a step into the market: Hotel Pagan, Borobudur Fried Chicken,
and so on.
While this kind of archaeology, maturing in the age of mech- [183] anical reproduction, was
profoundly political, it was political at such a deep level that almost everyone, including the
personnel of the colonial state (who, by the 1930s, were in most of Southeast Asia 90 per cent
native) was unconscious of the fact. It had all become normal and everyday. It was precisely
the infinite quotidian reproducibility of its regalia that revealed the real power of the state.
It is probably not too surprising that post-independence states, which exhibited marked
continuities with their colonial predecessors, inherited this form of political museumizing.
For example, on 9 November 1968, as part of the celebrations commemorating the 15th
anniversary of Cambodia's independence, Norodom Sihanouk had a large wood and papiermache
replica of the great Bayon temple of Angkor displayed in the national sports stadium
in Phnom Penh.35 The replica was exceptionally coarse and crude, but it served its purpose -
instant recognizability via a history of colonial-era logoization. 'Ah, our Bayon' - but with the
memory of French colonial restorers wholly banished. French-reconstructed Angkor Wat,
again in jigsaw' form, became, as noted in Chapter 9, the central symbol of the successive
flags of Sihanouk's royalist, Lon Nol's militarist, and Pol Pot's Jacobin regimes.
More striking still is evidence of inheritance at a more popular level. One revealing example
is a series of paintings of episodes in the national history commissioned by Indonesia's
Ministry of Education in the 1950s. The paintings were to be mass-produced and distributed
throughout the primary-school system; young Indonesians were to have on the walls of their
classrooms - everywhere - visual representations of their country's past. Most of the
backgrounds were done in the predictable sentimental-naturalist style of early-twentiethcentury
commercial art, and the human figures taken either from colonial-era museum
dioramas or from the popular wayang orang pseudohistorical folk-drama. The most
interesting of the series, however, offered children a representation of the Borobudur. In
reality, this colossal monument, with its 504 Buddha images, 1,460 pictorial and 1,212
decorative stone panels, is a fantastic storehouse of ancient Javanese sculpture. But the wellregarded
artist imagines the [184] marvel in its ninth century A.D. heyday with instructive
perversity. The Borobudur is painted completely white, with not a trace of sculpture visible.
Surrounded by well-trimmed lawns and tidy tree-lined avenues, not a single human being is
in sight.% One might argue that this emptiness reflects the unease of a contemporary Muslim
painter in the face of an ancient Buddhist reality. But I suspect that what we are really seeing
is an unselfconscious lineal descendant of colonial archaeology: the Borobudur as state
regalia, and as 'of course, that's it' logo. A Borobudur all the more powerful as a sign for
national identity because of everyone's awareness of its location in an infinite series of
identical Borobudurs.
Interlinked with one another, then, the census, the map and the museum illuminate the late
colonial state's style of thinking about its domain. The 'warp' of this thinking was a totalizing
classificatory grid, which could be applied with endless flexibility to anything under the
state's real or contemplated control: peoples, regions, religions, languages, products,
monuments, and so forth. The effect of the grid was always to be able to say of anything that
it was this, not that; it belonged here, not there. It was bounded, determinate, and therefore-in
principle-countable. (The comic classificatory and subclassificatory census boxes entitled
'Other' concealed all real-life anomalies by a splendid bureaucratic trompe I'oeil). The 'weft'
was what one could call serialization: the assumption that the world was made up of
replicable plurals. The particular always stood as a provisional representative of a series, and
was to be handled in this light. This is why the colonial state imagined a Chinese series
before any Chinese, and a nationalist series before the appearance of any nationalists.
No one has found a better metaphor for this frame of mind than the great Indonesian novelist
Pramoedya Ananta Toer, who entitled the final volume of his tetralogy on the colonial period
Rumah Kaca - the Glass House. It is an image, as powerful as Bentham's Panopticon, of total
surveyability. For the colonial state did not merely aspire to [185] create, under its control, a.
human landscape of perfect visibility; the condition of this 'visibility' was that everyone,
everything, had (as it were) a serial number.37 This style of imagining did not come out of
thin air. It was the product of the technologies of navigation, astronomy, horology, surveying,
photography and print, to say nothing of the deep driving power of capitalism.
Map and census thus shaped the grammar which would in due course make possible 'Burma'
and 'Burmese,' 'Indonesia' and 'Indonesians.' But the concretization of these possibilities -
con-cretizations which have a powerful life today, long after the colonial state has
disappeared - owed much to the colonial state's peculiar imagining of history and power.
Archaeology was an unimaginable enterprise in precolonial Southeast Asia; it was adopted in
uncolonized Siam late in the game, and after the colonial state's manner. It created the series
'ancient monuments,' segmented within the classificatory, geographic-demographic box
'Netherlands Indies,' and 'British Burma.' Conceived within this profane series, each ruin
became available for surveillance and infinite replication. As the colonial state's
archaeological service made it technically possible to assemble the series in mapped and
photographed form, the state itself could regard the series, up historical time, as an album of
its ancestors. The key thing was never the specific Borobudur, nor the specific Pagan, in
which the state had no substantial interest and with which it had only archaeological
connections. The replicable series, however, created a historical depth of field which was
easily inherited by the state's postcolonial successor. The final logical outcome was the logo -
of 'Pagan' or 'The Philippines,' it made little difference - which by its emptiness,
contextlessness, visual memorableness, and infinite reproducibility in every direction brought
census and map, warp and woof, into an inerasable embrace.

3. An astonishing variety of 'Europeans' were enumerated right through the colonial era. But whereas in 1881
they were still grouped primarily under the headings 'resident,' 'floating,' and 'prisoners,' by 1911 they were
fraternizing as members of a (white) race'. It is agreeable that up to the end, the census-makers were visibly
uneasy about where to place those they marked as 'Jews.'

5. In first half of the seventeenth century, Spanish settlements in the archipelago came under repeated attack
from the forces of the Vereenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie, the greatest 'transnational' corporation of the era.
For their survival, the pious Catholic settlers owed a great debt to the arch-heretical Protector, who kept
Amsterdam's back to the wall for much of his rule. Had the VOC been successful, Manila, rather than Batavia
[Jakarta], might have become the centre of the 'Dutch' imperium in Southeast Asia. In 1762, London seized
Manila from Spain, and held it for almost two years. It is entertaining to note that Madrid only got it back in
exchange for, of all places, Florida, and the other 'Spanish' possessions east of the Mississippi. Had the
negotiations proceeded differently, the archipelago could have been politically linked with Malaya and
Singapore during the nineteenth century.

19. I do not mean merely the inheritance and sale of private property in land in the usual sense. More important
was the European practice of political transfers of lands, with their populations, via dynastic marriages.
Princesses, on marriage, brought their husbands duchies and petty principalities, and these transfers were
formally negotiated and 'signed.' The tag Bellagerant alii, tu, felix Austria, nube! would have been
inconceivable for any state in precolonial Asia.
20. See Thongchai, 'Siam Mapped,' p. 387, on Thai ruling class absorption of this style of imagining. 'According
to these historical maps, moreover, the geobody is not a modern particularity but is pushed back more than a
thousand years. Historical maps thus help reject any suggestion that nationhood emerged only in the recent past,
and the perspective that the present Siam was a result of ruptures is precluded. So is any idea that intercourse
between Siam and the European powers was the parent of Siam.'
21. This adoption was by no means a Machiavellian ruse. The early nationalists in all the Southeast Asian
colonies had their consciousnesses profoundly shaped by the 'format' of the colonial state and its institutions.
See chapter 7 above.
22. In the writings of Nick Joaquin, the contemporary Philippines, preeminent man of letters - and an
indubitable patriot - one can see how powerfully the emblem works on the most sophisticated intelligence. Of
General Antonio Luna, tragic hero of the anti-American struggle of 1898-99, Joaquin writes that he hurried to
'perform the role that had been instinctive in the Creole for three centuries: the defense of the form of the
Philippines from a foreign disrupter.' A Question of Heroes, p. 164 (italics added). Elsewhere he observes,
astonishingly, that Spain's 'Filipino allies, converts, mercenaries sent against the Filipino rebel may have kept
the archipelago Spanish and Christian, but they also kept it from falling apart;' and that they 'were fighting
(whatever the Spaniards may have intended) to keep the Filipino one.' Ibid., p. 58.

24. Since 1963 there have been many bloody episodes in West New Guinea (now called Irian Jaya-Great Irian),
partly as a result of the militarization of the Indonesian state since 1965, partly because of the intermittently
effective guerrilla activities of the so-called OPM (Organization for a Free Papua). But these brutalities pale by
comparison with Jakarta's savagery in ex-Portuguese East Timor, where in the first three years after the 1976
invasion an estimated one-third of the population of 600,000 died from war, famine, disease and 'resettlement'. I
do not think it a mistake to suggest that the difference derives in part from East Timor's absence from the logos
of the Netherlands East Indies and, until 1976, of Indonesia's.
25. Osborne, Indonesia's Secret War, p. 2.
26. See above, p. 110.
27. The best sign for this is that the anti-Indonesian nationalist guerrilla organization's name, Organisasi Papua
Merdeka (OPM), is composed of Indonesian words.
28. In 1811, the East India Company's forces seized all the Dutch possessions in the Indies (Napoleon had
absorbed the Netherlands into France the previous year). Raffles ruled in Java till 1815. His monumental
History of Java appeared in 1817, two years prior to his founding of Singapore.
29. The museumizing of the Borobudur, the largest Buddhist stupa in the world, exemplifies this process. In
1814, the Raffles regime 'discovered' it, and had it unjungled. In 1845, the self-promoting German artistadventurer
Schaefer persuaded the Dutch authorities in Batavia to pay him to make the first daguerrotypes. In
1851, Batavia sent a team of state employees, led by civil engineer F.C. Wilsen, to make a systematic survey of
the bas-reliefs and to produce a complete, 'scientific' set of lithographs. In 1874, Dr. C. Leemans, Director of the
Museum of Antiquities in Leiden, published, at the behest of the Minister of Colonies, the first major scholarly
monograph; he relied heavily on Wilsen's lithographs, never having visited the site himself. In the 1880s, the
professional photographer Cephas produced a thorough modern-style photographic survey. In 1901, the colonial
regime established an Oudheidkundige Commissie (Commission on Antiquities). Between 1907 and 1911, the
Commission oversaw the complete restoration of the stupa, carried out at state expense by a team under the civil
engineer Van Erp. Doubtless in recognition of this success, the Commission was promoted, in 1913, to an
Oudheidkundigen Dienst (Antiquities Service), which kept the monument spick and span until the end of the
colonial period. See C. Leemans, Boro-Boudour, pp. ii-lv; and N.J. Krom, Inleiding tot de Hindoe-Javaansche
Kunst, I, chapter 1.
30. Viceroy Curzon (1899-1905), an antiquities buff who, writes Groslier, 'energized' the Archaeological Survey
of India, put things very nicely: 'It is. . . equally our duty to dig and discover, to classify, reproduce and describe,
to copy and decipher, and to cherish and conserve.' (Foucault could not have said it better). In 1899, the
Archaeological Department of Burma - then part of British India - was founded, and soon began the restoration
of Pagan. The previous year, the École Française d'Extrême-Orient was established in Saigon, followed almost
at once by a Directorate of Museums and Historical Monuments of Indochina. Immediately after the French
seizure of Siemreap and Battambang from Siam in 1907, an Angkor Conservancy was established to Curzonize
Southeast Asia's most awe-inspiring ancient monuments. See Bernard Philippe Groslier, Indochina, pp. 155-7,
174-7. As noted above, the Dutch colonial Antiquities Commission was founded in 1901. The coincidence in
dates - 1899, 1898, 1901 - shows not only the keenness with which the rival colonial powers observed one
another, but sea-changes in imperialism under way by the turn of the century. As was to be expected,
independent Siam ambled along more slowly. Its Archaeological Service was only set up in 1924, its National
Museum in 1926. See Charles Higham, The Archaeology of Mainland Southeast Asia, p. 25.
31. The VOC was liquidated, in bankruptcy, in 1799. The colony of the Netherlands Indies, however, dates from
1815, when the independence of The Netherlands was restored by the Holy Alliance, and Willem I of Orange
put on a Dutch throne first invented in 1806 by Napoleon and his kindly brother Louis. The British East India
Company survived till the great Indian Mutiny of 1857.
32. The Oudheidkundige Commissie was established by the same government that (in 1901) inaugurated the
new 'Ethical Policy' for the Indies, a policy that for the first time aimed to establish a Western-style system of
education for substantial numbers of the colonized. Governor-General Paul Doumer (1897-1902) created both
the Directorate of Museums and Historical Monuments of Indochina and the colony's modern educational
apparatus. In Burma, the huge expansion of higher education - which between 1900 and 1940 increased the
number of secondary-school students eightfold, from 27,401 to 233,543, and of college students twentyfold,
from 115 to 2,365 - began just as the Archaeological Department of Burma swung into action. See Robert H.
Taylor, The State in Burma, p. 114.
33. Influenced in part by this kind of thinking, conservative Thai intellrc tu.iK, archaeologists, and officials
persist to this day in attributing Angkor to tlir mysterious Khom, who vanished without a trace, and certainly
have no c omiri linn with today's despised Cambodians.
34. A fine late-blooming example is Ancient Indonesian Art, by the Dutch scholar, A.J. Bernet Kempers, selfdescribed
as 'former Director of Archaeology in Indonesia [sic].' On pages 24-5 one finds maps showing the
location of the ancient sites. The first is especially instructive, since its rectangular shape (framed on the east by
the 141st Meridian) willy-nilly includes Philippine Mindanao as well as British-Malaysian north Borneo,
peninsular Malaya, and Singapore. All are blank of sites, indeed of any naming whatsoever, except for a single,
inexplicable 'Kedah.' The switch from Hindu-Buddhism to Islam occurs after Plate 340.
35. See Kambuja, 45 (15 December 1968), for some curious photographs.
36. The discussion here draws on material analysed more fully in Language and Power, chapter 5.
37. An exemplary policy-outcome of Glass House imaginings-an outcome of which ex-political prisoner
Pramoedya is painfully aware-is the classificatory ID card that all adult Indonesians must now carry at all times.
This ID is isomorphic with the census- it represents a sort of political census, with special punching* for those
in the sub-series 'subversives'and 'traitors.' It is notable that this style of census was only perfected after the
achievement of national independence.
11. Memory and Forgetting
SPACE NEW AND OLD
[187] New York, Nueva Leon, Nouvelle Orleans, Nova Lisboa, Nieuw Amsterdam. Already
in the sixteenth century Europeans had begun the strange habit of naming remote places, first
in the Americas and Africa, later in Asia, Australia, and Oceania, as 'new' versions of
(thereby) 'old' toponyms in their lands of origin. Moreover, they retained the tradition even
when such places passed to different imperial masters, so the Nouvelle Orleans calmly
became New Orleans, and Nieuw Zeeland New Zealand.
It was not that, in general, the naming of political or religious sites as 'new' was in itself so
new. In Southeast Asia, for example, one finds towns of reasonable antiquity whose names
also include a term for novelty: Chiangmai (New City), Kota Bahru (New Town), Pekanbaru
(New Market). But in these names 'new' invariably has the meaning of'successor' to, or
'inheritor' of, something vanished. 'New' and 'old' are aligned diachronically, and the former
appears always to invoke an ambiguous blessing from the dead. What is startling in the
American namings of the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries is that 'new' and 'old' were
understood synchronically, coexisting within homogeneous, empty time. Vizcaya is there
alongside Nueva Vizcaya, New London alongside London: an idiom of sibling competition
rather than of inheritance.
[188] This new synchronic novelty could arise historically only when substantial groups of
people were in a position to think of themselves as living lives parallel to those of other
substantial groups of people - if never meeting, yet certainly proceeding along the same
trajectory. Between 1500 and 1800 an accumulation of technological innovations in the fields
of shipbuilding, navigation, horology and cartography, mediated through print-capitalism,
was making this type of imagining possible.1 It became conceivable to dwell on the Peruvian
altiplano, on the pampas of Argentina, or by the harbours of'New' England, and yet feel
connected to certain regions or communities, thousands of miles away, in England or the
Iberian peninsula. One could be fully aware of sharing a language and a religious faith (to
varying degrees), customs and traditions, without any great expectation of ever meeting one's
partners.2
For this sense of parallelism or simultaneity not merely to arise, but also to have vast political
consequences, it was necessary that the distance between the parallel groups be large, and
that the newer of them be substantial in size and permanently settled, as well as firmly
subordinated to the older. These conditions were met in the Americas as they had never been
before. In the first place, the vast expanse of the Atlantic Ocean and the utterly different
geographical conditions existing on each side of it, made impossible the sort of gradual
absorption of populations into larger politico-cultural units that transformed Las Espanas into
Espana and submerged Scotland into the United Kingdom. Secondly, as noted in Chapter 4,
European migration to the Americas took place on an astonishing scale. By the [189] end of
the eighteenth century there were no less than 3,200,000 'whites' (including no more than
150,000 peninsulares) within the 16,900,000 population of the Western empire of the
Spanish Bourbons.3 The sheer size of this immigrant community, no less than its
overwhelming military, economic and technological power vis-avis the indigenous
populations, ensured that it maintained its own cultural coherence and local political
ascendancy.4 Thirdly, the imperial metropole disposed of formidable bureaucratic and ideological
apparatuses, which permitted them for many centuries to impose their will on the
Creoles. (When one thinks of the sheer logistical problems involved, the ability of London
and Madrid to carry on long counter-revolutionary wars against rebel American colonists is
quite impressive.)
The novelty of all these conditions is suggested by the contrast they afford with the great (and
roughly contemporaneous) Chinese and Arab migrations into Southeast Asia and East Africa.
These migrations were rarely 'planned' by any metropole, and even more rarely produced
stable relations of subordination. In the Chinese case, the only dim parallel is the
extraordinary series of voyages far across the Indian ocean which were led, early in the
fifteenth century, by the brilliant eunuch admiral Cheng-ho. These daring enterprises, carried
out at the orders of the Yung-lo Emperor, were intended to enforce a court monopoly of
external trade with [190] Southeast Asia and the regions further west, against the
depredations of private Chinese merchants.5 By mid-century the failure of the policy was
clear; whereupon the Ming abandoned overseas adventures and did everything they could to
prevent emigration from the Middle Kingdom. The fall of southern China to the Manchus in
1645 produced a substantial wave of refugees into Southeast Asia for whom any political ties
with the new dynasty were unthinkable. Subsequent Ch'ing policy did not differ substantially
from that of the later Ming. In 1712, for example, an edict of the K'ang-hsi Emperor
prohibited all trade with Southeast Asia and declared that his government would 'request
foreign governments to have those Chinese who have been abroad repatriated so that they
may be executed.'6 The last great wave of overseas migration took place in the nineteenth
century as the dynasty disintegrated and a huge demand for unskilled Chinese labor opened
up in colonial Southeast Asia and Siam. Since virtually all migrants were politically cut off
from Peking, and were also illiterate people speaking mutually unintelligible languages, they
were either more or less absorbed into local cultures or were decisively subordinated to the
advancing Europeans.7
As for the Arabs, most of their migrations originated from the Hadramaut, never a real
metropole in the era of the Ottoman and Mughal empires. Enterprising individuals might find
ways to establish local principalities, such as the merchant who founded the kingdom of
Pontianak in western Borneo in 1772; but he married locally, soon lost his 'Arabness' if not
his Islam, and remained subordinated to the rising Dutch and English empires in Southeast
Asia, not to any power in the Near East. In 1832 Sayyid Sa'id, lord of Muscat, established a
powerful base on the East African coast and settled on the island of Zanzibar, which he made
the centre of a flourishing clove-growing economy. But the British used military [191] means
to compel him to sever his ties with Muscat.8 Thus neither Arabs nor Chinese, though they
ventured overseas in very large numbers during more or less the same centuries as the
Western Europeans, successfully established coherent, wealthy, selfconsciously Creole
communities subordinated to a great metropolitan core. Hence, the world never saw the rise
of New Basras or New Wuhans.
The doubleness of the Americas and the reasons for it, sketched out above, help to explain
why nationalism emerged first in the New World, not the Old.9 They also illuminate two
peculiar features of the revolutionary wars that raged in the New World between 1776 and
1825. On the one hand, none of the creole revolutionaries dreamed of keeping the empire
intact but rearranging its internal distribution of power, reversing the previous relationship of
subjection by transferring the metropole from a European to an American site.10 In other
words, the aim was not to have New London succeed, overthrow, or destroy Old London, but
rather to safeguard their continuing parallelism. (How new this style of thought was can be
inferred from the history of earlier empires in decline, where there was often a dream of
replacing the old centre.) On the other hand, although these wars caused a great deal of
suffering and were marked by much barbarity, in an odd way the stakes were rather low.
Neither in North nor in South America did the Creoles have to fear physical extermination or
reduction to servitude, as did so many other peoples who got in the way of the juggernaut of
European imperialism. They were after all 'whites,' Christians, and Spanish- or Englishspeakers;
they were also the intermediaries necessary to the metropoles if the economic
wealth of the Western empires was to continue under Europe's control. Hence, they were the
one significant extra- [192] European group, subjected to Europe, that at the same time had
no need to be desperately afraid of Europe. The revolutionary wars, bitter as they were, were
still reassuring in that they were wars between kinsmen.11 This family link ensured that, after
a certain period of acrimony had passed, close cultural, and sometimes political and
economic, ties could be reknit between the former metropoles and the new nations.
TIME NEW AND OLD
If for the Creoles of the New World the strange toponyms discussed above represented
figuratively their emerging capacity to imagine themselves as communities parallel and
comparable to those in Europe, extraordinary events in the last quarter of the eighteenth
century gave this novelty, quite suddenly, a completely new meaning. The first of these
events was certainly the Declaration of (the Thirteen Colonies') Independence in 1776, and
the successful military defence of that declaration in the years following. This independence,
and the fact that it was a republican independence, was felt to be something absolutely
unprecedented, yet at the same time, once in existence, absolutely reasonable. Hence, when
history made it possible, in 1811, for Venezuelan revolutionaries to draw up a constitution for
the First Venezuelan Republic, they saw nothing slavish in borrowing verbatim from the
Constitution of the United States of America.12 For what the men in Philadelphia had written
was in the Venezuelans' eyes not something North American, but rather something of
universal truth and value. Shortly thereafter, in 1789, the explosion in the New World was
paralleled in the Old by the volcanic outbreak of the French Revolution.13
[193] It is difficult today to recreate in the imagination a condition of life in which the nation
was felt to be something utterly new. But so it was in that epoch. The Declaration of
Independence of 1776 makes absolutely no reference to Christopher Columbus, Roanoke, or
the Pilgrim Fathers, nor are the grounds put forward to justify independence in any way
'historical,' in the sense of highlighting the antiquity of the American people. Indeed,
marvellously, the American nation is not even mentioned. A profound feeling that a radical
break with the past was occurring-a 'blasting open of the continuum of history'?-spread
rapidly. Nothing exemplifies this intuition better than the decision, taken by the Convention
Nationale on 5 October 1793, to scrap the centuries-old Christian calendar and to inaugurate
a new world-era with the Year One, starting from the abolition of the ancien regime and the
proclamation of the Republic on 22 September 1792.14 (No subsequent revolution has had
quite this sublime confidence of novelty, not least because the French Revolution has always
been seen as an ancestor.)
Out of this profound sense of newness came also nuestra santa revolution, the beautiful
neologism created by Jose Maria Morelos y Pavdn (proclaimer in 1813 of the Republic of
Mexico), not long before his execution by the Spaniards.15 Out of it too came San Martin's
1821 decree that 'in the future the aborigines shall not be called Indians or natives; they are
children and citizens of Peru and they shall be known as Peruvians.'16 This sentence does for
'Indians' and/or 'natives' what the Convention in Paris had done for the Christian calendar - it
abolished the old time-dishonoured naming and inaugurated a completely new epoch.
'Peruvians' and 'Year One' thus mark rhetorically a profound rupture with the existing world.
[194] Yet things could not long remain this way - for precisely the same reasons that had
precipitated the sense of rupture in the first place. In the last quarter of the eighteenth century,
Britain alone was manufacturing between 150,000 and 200,000 watches a year, many of them
for export. Total European manufacture is likely to have then been close to 500,000 items
annually.17 Serially published newspapers were by then a familiar part of urban civilization.
So was the novel, with its spectacular possibilities for the representation of simultaneous
actions in homogeneous empty time.18 The cosmic clocking which had made intelligible our
synchronic transoceanic pairings was increasingly felt to entail a wholly intramundane, serial
view of social causality; and this sense of the world was now speedily deepening its grip on
Western imaginations. It is thus understandable that less than two decades after the
Proclamation of Year One came the establishment of the first academic chairs in History- in
1810 at the University of Berlin, and in 1812 at Napoleon's Sorbonne. By the second quarter
of the nineteenth century History had become formally constituted as a 'discipline,' with its
own elaborate array of professional journals.19 Very quickly the Year One made way for 1792
A.D., and the revolutionary ruptures of 1776 and 1789 came to be figured as embedded in the
historical series and thus as historical precedents and models.20
Hence, for the members of what we might call 'second-generation' nationalist movements,
those which developed in Europe [195] between about 1815 to 1850, and also for the
generation that inherited the independent national states of the Americas, it was no longer
possible to 'recapture/The first fine careless rapture' of their revolutionary predecessors. For
different reasons and with different consequences, the two groups thus began the process of
reading nationalism genealogically - as the expression of an historical tradition of serial
continuity.
In Europe, the new nationalisms almost immediately began to imagine themselves as
'awakening from sleep,' a trope wholly foreign to the Americas. Already in 1803 (as we have
seen in Chapter 5) the young Greek nationalist Adamantios Koraes was telling a sympathetic
Parisian audience: 'For the first time the [Greek] nation surveys the hideous spectacle of its
ignorance and trembles in measuring with the eye the distance separating it from its ancestors'
glory.' Here is perfectly exemplified the transition from New Time to Old. 'For the first time'
still echoes the ruptures of 1776 and 1789, but Koraes 's sweet eyes are turned, not ahead to
San Martin's future, but back, in trembling, to ancestral glories. It would not take long for this
exhilarating doubleness to fade, replaced by a modular, 'continuous' awakening from a
chronologically gauged, A.D. -style slumber: a guaranteed return to an aboriginal essence.
Undoubtedly, many different elements contributed to the astonishing popularity of this
trope.21 For present purposes, I would mention only two. In the first place, the trope took into
account the sense of parallelism out of which the American nationalisms had been born and
which the success of the American nationalist revolutions had greatly reinforced in Europe. It
seemed to explain why nationalist movements had bizarrely cropped up in the civilized Old
World so obviously later than in the barbarous New. 22 Read as late awakening, even if an
awakening stimulated from afar, it opened up an immense [196] antiquity behind the epochal
sleep. In the second place, the trope provided a crucial metaphorical link between the new
European nationalisms and language. As observed earlier, the major states of nineteenthcentury
Europe were vast polyglot polities, of which the boundaries almost never coincided
with language-communities. Most of their literate members had inherited from mediaeval
times the habit of thinking of certain languages - if no longer Latin, then French, English,
Spanish or German-as languages of civilization. Rich eighteenth-century Dutch burghers
were proud to speak only French at home; German was the language of cultivation in much
of the western Czarist empire, no less than in 'Czech' Bohemia. Until late in the eighteenth
century no one thought of these languages as belonging to any territorially defined group. But
soon thereafter, for reasons sketched out in Chapter 3, 'uncivilized' vernaculars began to
function politically in the same way as the Atlantic Ocean had earlier done: i.e. to 'separate'
subjected national communities off from ancient dynastic realms. And since in the vanguard
of most European popular nationalist movements were literate people often unaccustomed to
using these vernaculars, this anomaly needed explanation. None seemed better than 'sleep,'
for it permitted those intelligentsias and bourgeoisies who were becoming conscious of
themselves as Czechs, Hungarians, or Finns to figure their study of Czech, Magyar, or
Finnish languages, folklores, and musics as 'rediscovering' something deep-down always
known. (Furthermore, once one starts thinking about nationality in terms of continuity, few
things seem as historically deep-rooted as languages, for which no dated origins can ever be
given.)23
In the Americas the problem was differently posed. On the one hand, national independence
had almost everywhere been internationally acknowledged by the 1830s. It had thus become
an inheritance, and, as an inheritance, it was compelled to enter a genealogical series. Yet the
developing European instrumentalities were not readily available. Language had never been
an issue in the [197] American nationalist movements. As we have seen, it was precisely the
sharing with the metropole of a common language (and common religion and common
culture) that had made the first national imaginings possible. To be sure, there are some
interesting cases where one detects a sort of 'European' thinking early at work. For example,
Noah Webster's 1828 (i.e., 'second-generation') American Dictionary of the English
Language was intended to give an official imprimatur to an American language whose
lineage was distinct from that of English. In Paraguay, the eighteenth-century Jesuit tradition
of using Guarani made it possible for a radically non-Spanish 'native' language to become a
national language, under the long, xenophobic dictatorship of Jose Caspar Rodriguez de
Francia (1814-1840). But, on the whole, any attempt to give historical depth to nationality via
linguistic means faced insuperable obstacles. Virtually all the Creoles were institutionally
committed (via schools, print media, administrative habits, and so on) to European rather than
indigenous American tongues. Any excessive emphasis on linguistic lineages threatened to
blur precisely that 'memory of independence' which it was essential to retain.
The solution, eventually applicable in both New and Old Worlds, was found in History, or
rather History emplotted in particular ways. We have observed the speed with which Chairs
in History succeeded the Year One. As Hayden White remarks, it is no less striking that the
five presiding geniuses of European historiography were all born within the quarter century
following the Convention's rupturing of time: Ranke in 1795, Michelet in 1798, Tocqueville
in 1805, and Marx and Burckhardt in 1818.24 Of the five, it is perhaps natural that Michelet,
self-appointed historian of the Revolution, most clearly exemplifies the national imagining
being born, for he was the first selfconciously to write on behalf of the dead.25 The following
passage is characteristic:
[198] Oui, chaque mort laisse un petit bien, sa mémoire, et demande qu'on la soigne. Pour celui qui
n'a pas d'amis, il faut que le magistral y supplée. Car la loi, la justice, est plus sûre que toutes nos
tendresses oublieuses, nos larmes si vite séchées. Cette magistrature, c'est l'Histoire. Et les morts
sont, pour dire comme le Droit romain, ces miserabiles personae dont le magistral doit se
préoccuper. Jamais dans ma carrière je n'ai pas perdu de vue ce devoir de l'historien. J'ai donné à
beaucoup de morts trop oubliés 1'assistance dont moi-même j'aurai besoin. Je les ai exhumés pour
une seconde vie ... Ils vivent maintenant avec nous qui nous sentons leurs parents, leurs amis.
Ainsi se fait une famille, une cité commune entre les vivants et les morts.26
Here and elsewhere Michelet made it clear that those whom he was exhuming were by no
means a random assemblage of forgotten, anonymous dead. They were those whose
sacrifices, throughout History, made possible the rupture of 1789 and the selfconscious
appearance of the French nation, even when these sacrifices were not understood as such by
the victims. In 1842, he noted of these dead: 'II leur faut un Oedipe qui leur explique leur
propre énigme dont ils n'ont pas eu le sens, qui leur apprenne ce que voulaient dire leurs
paroles, leurs actes, qu'ils n'ont pas compris.'27
This formulation is probably unprecedented. Michelet not only claimed to speak on behalf of
large numbers of anonymous dead people, but insisted, with poignant authority, that he could
say what they 'really' meant and 'really' wanted, since they themselves 'did not understand.'
From then on, the silence of the dead was no obstacle to the exhumation of their deepest
desires.
In this vein, more and more 'second-generation' nationalists, in the Americas and elsewhere,
learned to speak 'for' dead people with whom it was impossible or undesirable to establish a
linguistic connection. This reversed ventriloquism helped to open the way for a selfconscious
indigenismo, especially in the southern Americas. At the [199] edge: Mexicans speaking in
Spanish 'for' pre-Columbian 'Indian' civilizations whose languages they do not understand.28
How revolutionary this kind of exhumation was appears most clearly if we contrast it with the
formulation of Fermin de Vargas, cited in chapter 2. For where Fermin still thought
cheerfully of'extinguishing' living Indians, many of his political grandchildren became
obsessed with 'remembering,' indeed 'speaking for' them, perhaps precisely because they had,
by then, so often been extinguished.
THE REASSURANCE OF FRATRICIDE
It is striking that in Michelet's 'second generation' formulations the focus of attention is
always the exhumation of people and events which stand in danger of oblivion.29 He sees no
need to think about 'forgetting.' But when, in 1882-more than a century after the Declaration
of Independence in Philadelphia, and eight years after the death of Michelet himself - Renan
published his Q« 'est-ce qu 'une nation?, it was precisely the need for forgetting that
preoccupied him. Reconsider, for example, the formulation cited earlier in chapter I:30
Or, l'essence d'une nation est que tous les individus aient beaucoup de choses en commun et aussi
que tous aient oublié bien des choses. . . . Tout citoyen français doit avoir oublie la Saint-
Barthélemy, les massacres du Midi au XIIIe siècle.
[200] At first sight these two sentences may seem straightforward.31 Yet a few moments
reflection reveals how bizarre they actually are. One notices, for example, that Renan saw no
reason to explain for his readers what either 'la Saint-Barthélemy' or 'les massacres du Midi
au XIIIe siècle' meant. Yet who but 'Frenchmen,' as it were, would have at once understood
that 'la Saint-Barthélemy' referred to the ferocious anti-Huguenot pogrom launched on 24
August 1572 by the Valois dynast Charles IX and his Florentine mother; or that 'les
massacres du Midi' alluded to the extermination of the Albigensians across the broad zone
between the Pyrenees and the Southern Alps, instigated by Innocent III, one of the guiltier in
a long line of guilty popes? Nor did Renan find anything queer about assuming 'memories' in
his readers' minds even though the events themselves occurred 300 and 600 years previously.
One is also struck by the peremptory syntax of doit avoir oublié (not doit oublier) - 'obliged
already to have forgotten'-which suggests, in the ominous tone of revenue-codes and military
conscription laws, that 'already having forgotten' ancient tragedies is a prime contemporary
civic duty. In effect, Renan's readers were being told to 'have already forgotten' what Renan's
own words assumed that they naturally remembered!
How are we to make sense of this paradox? We may start by observing that the singular
French noun 'la Saint-Barthélemy' occludes killers and killed - i.e., those Catholics and
Protestants who played one local part in the vast unholy Holy War that raged across central
and northern Europe in the sixteenth century, and who certainly did not think of themselves
cozily together as 'Frenchmen.' Similarly, 'thirteenth-century massacres of the Midi' blurs
unnamed victims and assassins behind the pure Frenchness of'Midi.' No need to remind his
readers that most of the murdered Albigensians spoke Provençal or Catalan, and that their
murderers came from many parts of Western Europe. The effect of this tropology is to figure
episodes in the colossal religious conflicts of mediaeval and early modern Europe as
reassuringly fratricidal wars between - who else? - fellow Frenchmen. Since we can be
confident that, left to themselves, the overwhelming majority of Renan's French
contemporaries would [201] never have heard of ‘la Saint-Barthélemy' or 'les massacres du
Midi,' we become aware of a systematic historiographical campaign, deployed by the state
mainly through the state's school system, to 'remind' every young Frenchwoman and
Frenchman of a series of antique slaughters which are now inscribed as 'family history.'
Having to 'have already forgotten' tragedies of which one needs unceasingly to be 'reminded'
turns out to be a characteristic device in the later construction of national genealogies. (It is
instructive that Renan does not say that each French citizen is obliged to 'have already
forgotten' the Paris Commune. In 1882 its memory was still real rather than mythic, and
sufficiently painful to make it difficult to read under the sign of'reassuring fratricide.')
Needless to say, in all this there was, and is, nothing especially French. A vast pedagogical
industry works ceaselessly to oblige young Americans to remember/forget the hostilities of
1861-65 as a great 'civil' war between 'brothers' rather than between-as they briefly were-two
sovereign nation-states. (We can be sure, however, that if the Confederacy had succeeded in
maintaining its independence, this 'civil war' would have been replaced in memory by
something quite unbrotherly.) English history textbooks offer the diverting spectacle of a
great Founding Father whom every schoolchild is taught to call William the Conqueror. The
same child is not informed that William spoke no English, indeed could not have done so,
since the English language did not exist in his epoch; nor is he or she told 'Conqueror of
what?'. For the only intelligible modern answer would have to be 'Conqueror of the English,'
which would turn the old Norman predator into a more successful precursor of Napoleon and
Hitler. Hence 'the Conqueror' operates as the same kind of ellipsis as 'la Saint-Barthelemy,' to
remind one of something which it is immediately obligatory to forget. Norman William and
Saxon Harold thus meet on the battlefield of Hastings, if not as dancing partners, at least as
brothers.
But it is surely too easy to attribute these reassuring ancient fratricides simply to the icy
calculations of state functionaries. At another level they reflect a deep reshaping of the
imagination of which the state was barely conscious, and over which it had, and still has, only
exiguous control. In the 1930s people of many nationalities [202] went to fight in the Iberian
peninsula because they viewed it as the arena in which global historical forces and causes
were at stake. When the long-lived Franco regime constructed the Valley of the Fallen, it
restricted membership in the gloomy necropolis to those who, in its eyes, had died in the
world-struggle against Bolshevism and atheism. But, at the state's margins, a 'memory' was
already emerging of a 'Spanish' Civil War. Only after the crafty tyrant's death, and the
subsequent, startlingly smooth transition to bourgeois democracy-in which it played a crucial
role-did this 'memory' become official. In much the same way, the colossal class war that,
from 1918 to 1920, raged between the Pamirs and the Vistula came to be
remembered/forgotten in Soviet film and fiction as 'our' civil war, while the Soviet state, on
the whole, held to an orthodox Marxist reading of the struggle.
In this regard the Creole nationalisms of the Americas are especially instructive. For on the
one hand, the American states were for many decades weak, effectively decentralized, and
rather modest in their educational ambitions. On the other hand, the American societies, in
which 'white' settlers were counterposed to 'black' slaves and half-exterminated 'natives,' were
internally riven to a degree quite unmatched in Europe. Yet the imagining of that fraternity,
without which the reassurance of fratricide can not be born, shows up remarkably early, and
not without a curious authentic popularity. In the United States of America this paradox is
particularly well exemplified.
In 1840, in the midst of a brutal eight-year war against the Seminoles of Florida (and as
Michelet was summoning his Oedipus), James Fenimore Cooper published The Pathfinder,
the fourth of his five, hugely popular, Leatherstocking Tales. Central to this novel (and to all
but the first of its companions) is what Leslie Fiedler called the 'austere, almost inarticulate,
but unquestioned love' binding the 'white' woodsman Natty Bumppo and the noble Delaware
chieftain Chingachgook ('Chicago'!).32 Yet the Renanesque setting for their [203]
bloodbrotherhood is not the murderous 1830s but the last forgotten/ remembered years of
British imperial rule. Both men are figured as 'Americans,' fighting for survival - against the
French, their 'native' allies (the 'devilish Mingos'), and treacherous agents of George III.
When, in 1851, Herman Melville depicted Ishmael and Queequeg cozily in bed together at
the Spouter Inn ('there, then, in our hearts' honeymoon, lay I and Queequeg'), the noble
Polynesian savage was sardonically Americanized as follows:33
.... certain it was that his head was phrenologically an excellent one. It may seem ridiculous, but it
reminded me of George Washington's head, as seen in popular busts of him. It had the same long
regularly graded retreating slope above the brows, which were likewise very projecting, like two
long promontories thickly wooded on top. Queequeg was George Washington cannibalistically
developed.
It remained for Mark Twain to create in 1881, well after the 'Civil War' and Lincoln's
Emancipation Proclamation, the first indelible image of black and white as American
'brothers': Jim and Huck companionably adrift on the wide Mississippi.34 But the setting is a
remembered/forgotten antebellum in which the black is still a slave.
These striking nineteenth-century imaginings of fraternity, emerging 'naturally' in a society
fractured by the most violent racial, class and regional antagonisms, show as clearly as
anything else that nationalism in the age of Michelet and Renan represented a new form of
consciousness - a consciousness that arose when it was no longer possible to experience the
nation as new, at the wave-top moment of rupture.
THE BIOGRAPHY OF NATIONS
[204] All profound changes in consciousness, by their very nature, bring with them
characteristic amnesias. Out of such oblivions, in specific historical circumstances, spring
narratives. After experiencing the physiological and emotional changes produced by puberty,
it is impossible to 'remember' the consciousness of childhood. How many thousands of days
passed between infancy and early adulthood vanish beyond direct recall! How strange it is to
need another's help to learn that this naked baby in the yellowed photograph, sprawled
happily on rug or cot, is you. The photograph, fine child of the age of mechanical
reproduction, is only the most peremptory of a huge modern accumulation of documentary
evidence (birth certificates, diaries, report cards, letters, medical records, and the like) which
simultaneously records a certain apparent continuity and emphasizes its loss from memory.
Out of this estrangement comes a conception of personhood, identity (yes, you and that naked
baby are identical) which, because it can not be 'remembered,' must be narrated. Against
biology's demonstration that every single cell in a human body is replaced over seven years,
the narratives of autobiography and biography flood print-capitalism's markets year by year.
These narratives, like the novels and newspapers discussed in Chapter 2, are set in
homogeneous, empty time. Hence their frame is historical and their setting sociological. This
is why so many autobiographies begin with the circumstances of parents and grandparents,
for which the autobiographer can have only circumstantial, textual evidence; and why the
biographer is at pains to record the calendrical, A.D. dates of two biographical events which
his or her subject can never remember: birth-day and death-day. Nothing affords a sharper
reminder of this narrative's modernity than the opening of the Gospel according to St.
Matthew. For the Evangelist gives us an austere list of thirty males successively begetting one
another, from the Patriarch Abraham down to Jesus Christ. (Only once is a woman
mentioned, not because she is a begetter, but because she is a non-Jewish Moabite). No dates
are given for any of Jesus's forebears, let alone sociological, cultural, physiological or
political information about them. This narrative [205] style (which also reflects the rupturein-
Bethlehem become memory) was entirely reasonable to the sainted genealogist because he
did not conceive of Christ as an historical 'personality,' but only as the true Son of God.
As with modern persons, so it is with nations. Awareness of being imbedded in secular, serial
time, with all its implications of continuity, yet of 'forgetting' the experience of this
continuity-product of the ruptures of the late eighteenth century - engenders the need for a
narrative of 'identity.' The task is set for Michelet's magistrate. Yet between narratives of
person and nation there is a central difference of employment. In the secular story of the
'person' there is a beginning and an end. She emerges from parental genes and social
circumstances onto a brief historical stage, there to play a role until her death. After that,
nothing but the penumbra of lingering fame or influence. (Imagine how strange it would be,
today, to end a life of Hitler by observing that on 30 April 1945 he proceeded straight to
Hell). Nations, however, have no clearly identifiable births, and their deaths, if they ever
happen, are never natural.35 Because there is no Originator, the nation's biography can not be
written evangelically, 'down time,' through a long procreative chain of begettings. The only
alternative is to fashion it 'up time'- towards Peking Man, Java Man, King Arthur, wherever
the lamp of archaeology casts its fitful gleam. This fashioning, however, is marked by deaths,
which, in a curious inversion of conventional genealogy, start from an originary present.
World War II begets World War I; out of Sedan comes Austerlitz; the ancestor of the Warsaw
Uprising is the state of Israel.
Yet the deaths that structure the nation's biography are of a special kind. In all the 1,200
pages of Fernand Braudel's awesome La Mediterrane'e et le Monde Mediterraneen a
I'Epoque de Philippe II no mention is ever made of 'la Saint-Barthelemy,' though it occurred
at almost exactly the midpoint of Felipe II's reign. ForBraudel, the deaths that matter are
those myriad anonymous events, which, aggregated and averaged into secular mortality rates,
permit him to chart the slow-changing conditions of life for millions of anonymous human
beings of whom the last question asked is their nationality.
[206] From Braudel's remorselessly accumulating cemeteries, however, the nation's
biography snatches, against the going mortality rate, exemplary suicides, poignant
martyrdoms, assassinations, executions, wars, and holocausts. But, to serve the narrative
purpose, these violent deaths must be remembered/forgotten as 'our own.'
1. The accumulation reached a frantic zenith in the 'international' (i.e., European) search for an accurate measure
of longitude, amusingly recounted in Landes, Revolution in Time, chapter 9. In 1776, as the Thirteen Colonies
declared their independence, the Gentleman's Magazine included this brief obituary for John Harrison: 'He was
a most ingenious mechanic, and received the 20,000 pounds reward [from Westminster] for the discovery of the
longitude [sic].'
2. The late spreading of this consciousness to Asia is deftly alluded to in the opening pages of Pramoedya
Ananta Toer's great historical novel Bumi Manusia [Earth of Mankind]. The young nationalist hero muses that
he was born on the same date as the future Queen Wilhelmina - 31 August 1880. 'But while my island was
wrapped in the darkness of night, her country was bathed in sun; and if her country was embraced by night's
blackness, my island glittered in the equatorial noon." p. 4.
3. Needless to say, 'whiteness' was a legal category which had a distinctly tangential relationship to complex
social realities. As the Liberator himself put it, 'We are the vile offspring of the predatory Spaniards who came
to America to bleed her white and to breed with their victims. Later the illegitimate offspring of these unions
joined with the offspring of slaves transported from Africa.' Italics added. Lynch, The Spanish-American
Revolutions, p. 249. One should beware of assuming anything 'eternally European" in this criollismo.
Remembering all those devoutly Buddhist-Singhalese Da Souzas, those piously Catholic-Florinese Da Silvas,
and those cynically Catholic-Manileno Sorianos who play unproblematic social, economic, and political roles in
contemporary Ceylon, Indonesia, and the Philippines, helps one to recognize that, under the right circumstances,
Europeans could be-gently absorbed into non-European cultures.
4. Compare the fate of the huge African immigrant population. The brut.il mechanisms of slavery ensured not
merely its political-cultural fragmentation, but also vrry rapidly removed the possibility of imagining black
communities in Vrnr7ucla .md West Africa moving in parallel trajectory.
5. See O.W. Wolters, The Fall of Srivijaya in Malay History, Appendix C.
6. Cited in G. William Skinner, Chinese Society in Thailand, pp. 15-16.
7. Overseas Chinese communities loomed large enough to stimulate deep European paranoia up to the mid
eighteenth century, when vicious anti-Chinese pogroms by Westerners finally ceased. Thereafter, this unlovely
tradition was passed on to indigenous populations.
8. See Marshall G. Hodgson, The Venture of Islam, Vol. 3, pp. 233-5.
9. It is an astonishing sign of the depth of Eurocentrism that so many European icholars persist, in the face of all
the evidence, in regarding nationalism as a European invention.
10. But note the ironic case of Brazil. In 1808, King Joao VI fled to Rio de Janeiro to escape Napoleon's armies.
Though Wellington had expelled the French by 1811, ihe emigrant monarch, fearing republican unrest at home,
stayed on in South America until 1822, so that between 1808 and 1822 Rio was the centre of a world empire
stretching to Angola, Mozambique, Macao, and East Timor. But this empire wa» ruled by a European, not an
American.
11. Doubtless this was what permitted the Liberator to exclaim at one point that a Negro, i.e. slave, revolt would
be 'a thousand times worse than a Spanish invasion.' (See above, p. 49). A slave jacquerie, if successful, might
mean the physical extermination of the Creoles.
12. See Masur, Bolivar, p. 131.
13. The French Revolution was in turn paralleled in the New World by the outbreak of Toussaint L'Ouverture's
insurrection in 1791, which by 1806 had resulted in Haiti's former slaves creating the second independent
republic of the Western hemisphere.
14. The young Wordsworth was in France in 1791-1792, and later, in The Prelude, wrote these famous
reminiscent lines:
Bliss was it in that dawn to be alive,
But to be young was very heaven!
Italics added.
15. Lynch, The Spanish-American Revolutions, pp. 314-15.
16. As cited above in chapter 4.
17. Landes, Revolution in Time, pp. 230-31, 442-43.
18. See above, Chapter 2.
19. See Hayden White, Metahistory: The Historical Imagination in Nineteenth-Century Europe, pp. 135-43, for
a sophisticated discussion of this transformation.
20. But it was an A.D. with a difference. Before the rupture it still retained, however fragilely in enlightened
quarters, a theological aura glowing from within its medieval Latin. Anno Domini recalled that irruption of
eternity into mundane time which took place in Bethlehem. After the rupture, reduced monogrammati-cally to
A.D., it joined an (English) vernacular B.C., Before Christ, that encompassed a serial cosmological history (to
which the new science of geology was making signal contributions). We may judge how deep an abyss yawned
between Anno Domini and A.D./B.C. by noting that neither the Buddhist nor the Islamic world, even today,
imagines any epoch marked as 'Before the Gautama Buddha' or 'Before the Hegira.' Both make uneasy do with
the alien monogram B.C.
21. As late as 1951, the intelligent Indonesian socialist Lintong Mulia Sitorus could still write that: 'Till the end
of the nineteenth century, the coloured peoples •till slept soundly, while the whites were busily at work in every
field." Sedjarah Pergerakan Kebangsaan Indonesia [History of the Indonesian Nationalist Movement], p. 5. '
22. One could perhaps say that these revolutions were, in European eyes, the 1'irit really important political
events that had ever occurred across the Atlantic.
23. Still, historical depth is not infinite. At some point English vanishes into Norman French and Anglo-Saxon;
French into Latin and 'German' Prankish; and so on. We shall see below how additional depth of field came to
be achieved.
24. Metahistory, p. 140. Hegel, born in 1770, was already in his late teens when the Revolution broke out, but
his Vorlesungen iiber die Philosophie der Weltgeschtihte were only published in 1837, six years after his death.
25. White, Metahistory, p. 159.
26. Jules Michelet, Oeuvres Comptetes, XXI, p. 268, in the preface to volume 2 ('Jusqu'au 18e Brumaire') of his
uncompleted Histoire du XIXe Siecle. I owe the reference to Metahistory, but the translation White uses is
unsatisfactory.
27. Cited in Roland Barthes, ed., Michelet par lui-meme, p. 92. The volume of the Oeuvres Competes containing
this quotation has not yet been published.
28. Conversely, in all Mexico there is only one statue of Hernan Cortes. This monument, tucked discreetly away
in a niche of Mexico City, was only put up at the end of the 1970s, by the odious regime of Jose Lopez Portillo.
29. Doutbless because for much of his life he suffered under restored or ersatz legitimacies. His commitment to
1789 and to France is movingly shown by his refusal to swear an oath of loyalty to Louis Napoleon. Abruptly
dismissed from his post as National Archivist, he lived in near-poverty till his death in 1874-long enough,
however, to witness the mountebank's fall and the restoration of republican institutions.
30. Renan was born in 1823, a quarter of a century after Michelet, and passed much of his youth under the
cynically official-nationalist regime of Michelet's persecutor.
31. I understood them so in 1983, alas.
32. See his Love and Death in the American Novel, p. 192. Fiedler read this relationship psychologically, and
ahistorically, as an instance of American fiction's failure to deal with adult heterosexual love and its obsession
with death, incest, and innocent homoeroticism. Rather than a national eroticism, it is, I suspect, an eroticized
nationalism that is at work. Male-male bondings in a Protestant society which from the start rigidly prohibited
miscegenation are paralleled by male-female 'holy loves' in the nationalist fiction of Latin America, where
Catholicism permitted the growth of a large mestizo population. (It is telling that English has had to borrow
'mestizo' from Spanish.)
33. Herman Melville, Moby Dick, p. 71. How the author must have savoured the malignant final phrase!
34. It is agreeable to note that the publication of Huckleberry Finn preceded by only a few months Renan's
evocation of 'la Saint-Barthélemy.'
35. For such apocalypses the neologism 'genocide' was quite recently coined
